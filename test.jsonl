Cryptography allows digital currency transactions to be pseudonymous, secure, and “trustless” – with no bank or other intermediary required.\nThe “crypto” in the word “cryptocurrency” means “secret” in Greek – which gives you a clue as to what the field of cryptography is all about. Cryptography is the study and practice of sending secure, encrypted messages or data between two or more parties. The sender “encrypts” the message, which obscures its content to a third party, and the receiver “decrypts” the message, making it legible again. \nCryptocurrencies use cryptography to allow transactions to be anonymous, secure, and “trustless,” which means you don’t need to know anything about a person to safely make transactions with them – and you don’t need bank, credit-card company, government, or any other third party in the middle. And cryptography isn’t just important for digital money — our computer and the networks it’s attached to are encrypting and decrypting data constantly, from every Google search you make to every email you send.\nCryptocurrencies are entirely based on cryptographic ideas. was invented by a pseudonymous person (or group of people) going by the name of Satoshi Nakamoto, who proposed the idea in the form of a whitepaper posted to a cryptography message board in 2009. \nThe thorniest issue that Nakamoto solved was something called the double-spend problem. Because is just code, what’s to stop a person from making and spending multiple copies of their money? Nakamoto’s solution was based on a well-known encryption arrangement known as public-private key encryption. \n(as well as and many other cryptocurrencies) uses a technology called public-private key encryption. This allows them to be “trustless” – and makes secure transactions between strangers possible without a “trusted intermediary” like a bank or Paypal in the middle.\n  * The Bitcoin network issues all users a private key (essentially a really strong password) from which it cryptographically generates a linked public key. You can freely give people your public key – in fact, that’s the only piece of information anyone needs to send you Bitcoin. But to access those funds, the private key is required. \n  * Your public key is generated from your private key via a method called “hashing” – which is taking a string of data and processing it through an algorithm. It’s virtually impossible to reverse this process, so nobody can guess your private key from your public key.\n  * Because your public and private keys are linked, the network knows that your bitcoin belong to you – and will remain yours as long as you have your private key. \n  * Another impact of not having an intermediary is that Bitcoin transactions are irreversible (after all, there is no credit-card company to call if you make a mistake). But this is a feature, not a bug: permanent transactions are a key part of the solution to the double spend problem.\n  * The other half of the solution is the Bitcoin blockchain, which is a giant, decentralized ledger – imagine a bank’s balance books – that documents every transaction and is constantly verified and updated by all the computers in the network.\n\n\nInformation provided on this Site is for general educational purposes only and is not intended to constitute investment or other advice on financial products.

{"url": "https://www.investopedia.com/decentralized-finance-defi-5113835", "title": "Understanding Decentralized Finance (DeFi): Basics and Functionality", "markdown": "\n\n\n\n\n\nDecentralized finance (DeFi) is an emerging financial system using blockchain and cryptocurrencies to enable direct transactions between individuals and businesses. By eliminating intermediaries like banks, DeFi aims to reduce costs and speed up processes, although it's currently in its infancy and presents security challenges. \nIn the United States, the Federal Reserve and Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) define the rules for like banks and brokerages, which consumers rely on to access capital and financial services directly. DeFi challenges this centralized financial system by empowering individuals with peer-to-peer transactions. \n\n\nThrough peer-to-peer financial networks, DeFi uses security protocols, connectivity, software, and hardware advancements. This system eliminates intermediaries like banks and other financial service companies. These companies charge businesses and customers for using their services, which are necessary in the current system because it's the only way to make it work. DeFi uses blockchain technology to reduce the need for these intermediaries. \nA blockchain is a distributed and secured database or ledger. In a blockchain, transactions are recorded in files called blocks and verified through automated processes. If a transaction is verified, the block is closed and encrypted; another block is created with information about the previous block and information about newer transactions. \nThe offers that appear in this table are from partnerships from which Investopedia receives compensation. This compensation may impact how and where listings appear. Investopedia does not include all offers available in the marketplace.\nThe blocks are \"chained\" together through the information in each proceeding block, giving it the name . Information in previous blocks cannot be changed without affecting the following blocks, so blockchains are generally very secure if their networks are large and fast enough. This concept, along with other security protocols, provides the secure nature of a blockchain. \nUsing applications called wallets that can send information to a blockchain, individuals hold private keys to tokens or cryptocurrencies that act like passwords. These keys give them access to virtual tokens that represent value. Ownership of the tokens is transferred by 'sending' an amount to another entity via a wallet, whose wallet, in turn, generates a different private key for them. This secures their ownership of the token, and the blockchain design prevents the transfer from being reversed. \nDeFi applications are designed to communicate with a blockchain, allowing people to use their money for purchases, loans, gifts, trading, or any other way they want without a third party. These applications are programs installed on a device like a personal computer, tablet, or smartphone that make it easier to use. Without the applications, DeFi would still exist, but users would need to be comfortable and familiar with using the command line or terminal in the operating system that runs their device. \nDeFi applications provide an interface that automates transactions between users by giving them financial options to choose from. For example, if you want to make a loan to someone and charge them interest, you can select the option on the interface and enter terms like interest or collateral. If you need a loan, you can search for providers, which could range from a bank to an individual who could lend you some cryptocurrency after you agree on terms. \nSome applications let you enter parameters for the services you're looking for and match you with another user. Because the blockchain is a global network, you can give or receive financial services to or from anywhere in the world. \nDecentralized finance does not provide full anonymity. Transactions do not include an individual's name but are traceable by anyone with the knowledge to do so. This includes governments and law enforcement, which, at times, are necessary for protecting an individual's financial interests.\n  * : published on a blockchain and records of completed transactions are available for anyone to review but do not reveal your identity. Blockchains are generally immutable, meaning they cannot be altered.\n\n\nunder DeFi doesn't mean there won't be any interest and fees. However, it does mean that you'll have many more options since the lender can be anywhere and anyone in the world.\n1. Research activities in DeFi that interest you.2. Choose a suitable digital wallet for DeFi applications.3. Purchase cryptocurrency through a reputable exchange.4. Identify a DeFi app that suits your needs, such as borrowing or yield farming.5. Begin by integrating your cryptocurrency with the selected app. \nDeFi is an all-inclusive term for any application that uses blockchain and cryptocurrency techniques or technology to offer financial services. Some of these applications can provide anything from basic services like savings accounts to more advances services like providing liquidity to businesses or investors. One of the more notable DeFi service providers is Aave, which is a \"decentralized non-custodial liquidity market protocol\" that allows anyone to participate as a liquidity supplier or borrower. \nDecentralized finance, originally conceived of as a way to bring financial services like loans and banking to , has morphed into an industry where you can take part in many different sectors or endeavors. Here are a few of the most popular: \n  * : Liquidity is the ability to sell assets quickly, a problem many cryptocurrency users have encountered. Liquidity providers are generally pools where users place funds so exchanges can provide selling opportunities for their users. \n  * There are hundreds of defi apps available that provide lending. Generally, they operate the same way as a liquidity pool, where users lock their funds in a pool and let others borrow them, receiving interest on their loans—called yield farming. Many provide flash loans, where no collateral is required from the borrower.\n  * : Everyday, millions of dollars in cryptocurrency are used in DeFi gambling and prediction apps like Polymarket, ZKasino, Horse Racing Slot Keno Roulett, Azuro, and JuicyBet. Prediction markets are platforms that let you place bets on the outcome of nearly any event. \n\n\nJust like other blockchain- and cryptocurrency-related projects, businesses, and activities, decentralized finance is subject to considerable hype and misinformation, hoping to attract users and their money. Cryptocurrency, blockchain, and all technologies associated with them are also subject to extreme price volatility. \nThere is a considerable amount of money flowing through cryptocurrency exchanges, but it isn't nearly as much as you might be led to believe. Most people still use the traditional financial systems we are all used to. For example, of all money is tied up in cryptocurrency and decentralized finance—a very small figure that should encourage you to do your research to learn if using or investing in DeFi apps, platforms, and cryptocurrency is worth it. \nA crypto-winter is a period where crypto prices continuously move down and then stay down—sometimes tens of thousands of dollars. The last one occurred between 2022 and 2023. Prices had been rising significantly before 2022 as investors turned to anything they could find following the initial outbreak of COVID-19 and the ensuing pandemic. During that time, they discovered Bitcoin was not only holding value; it was increasing as well—but this was most likely due to their own self-fulfilling prophecies and hype as they drove the price increases themselves. \nBut toward the end of 2022, prices began declining and stayed there. Billions of dollars were lost during this time. During this period, there were no rumors of substance or any regulatory developments (in the U.S.) beyond a perceived campaign of persecution orchestrated by the Securities and Exchange Commission. However, when rumors began circulating about a Spot Bitcoin ETF approval in October 2023, the hyping began again, and prices rose. When the approval of 11 Bitcoin Spot ETFs was announced in January 2024, prices climbed steadily for a few months (supposedly ending the winter) until a sideways—yet volatile—market emerged again in March 2024. \nDeFi might be just what you're looking for regarding your finances. However, it might not—the decentralized finance industry is still in its infancy and evolving, making it somewhat of a gamble for most people. \nThe low amount of actual money invested in cryptocurrency and the effects that hype has on prices should make you consider whether investing in decentralized finance is worth it. If you have money you can afford to lose, the space can be very profitable—but the losses can be just as significant. \nIf you don't have money to lose and are looking for ways to fund your retirement or grow your portfolio or net worth over time, defi and cryptocurrency should be the last investment you should consider. They are still too new and volatile to risk your future on. \nDecentralized finance is constantly evolving. It is unregulated, and its ecosystem is vulnerable to faulty programming, hacks, and scams. For example, one of the main ways hackers and thieves steal cryptocurrency is through weaknesses in DeFi applications. \nLaws have not yet caught up with advances in technology. Most current laws were crafted based on the idea of separate financial jurisdictions, each with its own set of laws and rules. DeFi’s borderless transaction ability presents essential questions for this type of regulation. For example: \nYes, there are ways to make money using DeFi, such as yield farming or providing liquidity. However, there are risks involved, so it pays to do your research before locking money into DeFi.\nDeFi is still in its infancy, with hacks and thefts common. There are many people using it to make money and transact, but in its current state it is not yet as safe as traditional finance methods.\nDecentralized finance is a blanket term for the global system of blockchains and applications that are being developed to allow people to transact directly with each other using cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin. Bitcoin is a cryptocurrency that can be used in DeFi.\nDecentralized finance (DeFi) is a groundbreaking alternative to traditional financial systems, aiming to reduce reliance on centralized institutions and promote peer-to-peer transactions using blockchain technology. While promising, DeFi remains in its infancy, presenting vulnerabilities to hacks and regulatory challenges. Potential users should approach cautiously, keeping in mind its risks and the minor proportion of financial capital currently in DeFi. Research and a thorough understanding of DeFi applications can empower individuals to navigate this nascent field effectively. Although traditional financial systems pose challenges, they are well-established and likely to adapt and participate in blockchain-based financial innovations. \nCould you be getting more from your CFD trading? with razor-sharp spreads, low commission and deep liquidity.

{"url": "https://www.coinbase.com/learn/tips-and-tutorials/how-to-set-up-a-crypto-wallet", "title": "How to set up a crypto wallet | Coinbase", "markdown": "A crypto wallet is a place where you can securely keep your crypto. There are many different types of crypto wallets, but the most popular ones are hosted wallets, non-custodial wallets, and hardware wallets. \nThe most popular and easy-to-set-up crypto wallet is a hosted wallet. When you buy crypto using an app like Coinbase, your crypto is automatically held in a hosted wallet. It’s called because a third party keeps your crypto for you, similar to how a bank keeps your money in a checking or savings account. You may have heard of people “losing their keys” or “losing their USB wallet” but with a hosted wallet you don’t have to worry about any of that.\nThe main benefit of keeping your crypto in a hosted wallet is if you forget your password, you won’t lose your crypto. A drawback to a hosted wallet is you can’t access everything crypto has to offer. However, that may change as hosted wallets start to support more features.\n  1. Most crypto platforms and exchanges allow you to buy crypto using a bank account or credit card. If you already own crypto, you can also transfer it to your new hosted wallet for safe keeping.\n\n\nA self-custody wallet, like , puts you in complete control of your crypto. Non-custodial wallets don’t rely on a third party — or a “custodian” — to keep your crypto safe. While they provide the software necessary to store your crypto, the responsibility of remembering and safeguarding your password falls entirely on you. If you lose or forget your password — often referred to as a “private key” or “seed phrase” — there’s no way to access your crypto. And if someone else discovers your private key, they’ll get full access to your assets. \nWhy have a non-custodial wallet? In addition to being in full control of the security of your crypto, you can also access more advanced crypto activities like yield farming, staking, lending, borrowing, and more. But if all you want to do is buy, sell, send, and receive crypto, a hosted wallet is the easiest solution.\n  1. It’s presented as a random 12-word phrase. Keep it in a secure location. If you lose or forget this 12-word phrase you won’t be able to access your crypto.\n  2. . It’s not always possible to buy crypto using traditional currencies (like US dollars or Euros) with a non-custodial wallet, so you’ll need to transfer crypto into your non-custodial wallet from elsewhere. \n\n\nIf you’re a Coinbase customer, you have your choice of a hosted wallet or a self-custody wallet. The Coinbase app, where you buy and sell crypto, is a hosted wallet. You can also download the standalone to take advantage of the benefits of a non-custodial wallet. Some of our customers have both, making it easy to buy crypto with traditional currency as well as participate in advanced crypto activities. Setting up either wallet is free.\nA hardware wallet is a physical device, about the size of a thumb drive, that stores the private keys to your crypto offline. Most people don’t use hardware wallets because of their increased complexity and cost, but they do have some benefits — for example, they can keep your crypto secure even if your computer is hacked. However, this advanced security makes them inconvenient to use compared to a software wallet and they can cost upwards of $100 to buy. \n  1. Each brand has their own software that’s needed to set up your wallet. Download the software from the official company website and follow the instructions to create your wallet.\n  2. Similar to a non-custodial wallet, a hardware wallet typically doesn’t allow you to buy crypto using traditional currencies (like US dollars or Euros), so you’ll need to transfer crypto to your wallet.\n\n\nJust as there are many ways to store cash (in a bank account, in a safe, under the bed), there are many ways to store crypto. You can keep things simple with a hosted wallet, have full control of your crypto with a non-custodial wallet, take extra precautions with a hardware wallet, or even have multiple types of wallets — with crypto the choice is yours.\nInformation provided on this Site is for general educational purposes only and is not intended to constitute investment or other advice on financial products.

Cryptocurrency was conceived as a medium for daily transactions but has yet to gain widespread traction as a currency. Meanwhile, it has become popular with speculators and traders interested in making a quick buck off its volatility. \nThe addressed cryptocurrency transactions in its notice 2014-21. The agency stated that cryptocurrencies would be treated as assets similar to property. In 2020, the IRS began including a question on its to determine whether the taxpayer had any cryptocurrency transactions during the given tax year. \nDepending on the type of transaction, assets are subject to various kinds of taxes. However, the unique characteristics and use cases for Bitcoin mean that there are many exceptions with continually evolving tax legislation. \n\n\nBitcoin is an idea, a token of ownership of a certain value amount. Its value is determined by its market price on the day it is bought or sold—this price changes, sometimes by the minute. \nIt is treated by users as a medium of exchange, investors as a store of value, and traders as a means to profit from price movements. In the U.S., it is taxed as property by the IRS. \nBecause they are property, Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies are assets that require tax reporting when specific actions are taken. Depending on when and how someone acquires and uses cryptocurrency, they could be subject to capital gains or income taxes. \nThe offers that appear in this table are from partnerships from which Investopedia receives compensation. This compensation may impact how and where listings appear. Investopedia does not include all offers available in the marketplace.\nWhen you sell a virtual currency you've held for more than one year, you must recognize capital gains or losses on the sale. Any gain or loss is calculated based on the cryptocurrency's market value on the day and time you bought it (its basis). \nThe gains or losses recognized are subject to limitations on the deductibility of the taxpayer's capital losses. This tax legislation is determined by IRS Publication 544 (Sales and Other Dispositions of Assets). Capital gains are reported on of a taxpayer's Form 1040. \nIn the broadest sense, gains and losses on the sale of Bitcoin are treated the same as other capital assets such as stocks, bonds, precious metals, or certain personal property, Short-term capital gains are taxed as ordinary income and assessed at the same tax rate as the taxpayer's salary or wages. Long-term capital gains are taxed at a rate that varies on the taxpayer's income. \nThe IRS has provided specific guidance on transactions involving digital assets that are to be included in a tax return. Note that the extent of these transactions may make for difficulty when tracking all transactions; cryptocurrency investors and users are advised to seek tax advisor guidance to ensure all of the following transactions are adequately being reported: \n\n\nIn its broadest sense, the tax basis of Bitcoin used to determine your gain or loss is the cost for which the digital currency was obtained or its market price at the time it was acquired. For example, assume you acquired 100,000 when Bitcoin traded at $20,000/coin. The cost basis of the acquisition would be $20. \nIn the example above, should the Bitcoin be sold for $25 more than one year later, a $5 taxable capital gain would occur. If the Bitcoin were sold for $14, a $6 loss would occur. If you sold it for $25 six months later, $5 in taxable income would need to be reported. \nThe tax basis of Bitcoin becomes more complicated as less straightforward transactions occur. For example, an investor may receive airdropped tokens or tokens in exchange for a service at no cost. In most of these situations, the airdropped digital currencies would have a basis equal to the fair market value at the time of acquisition. This tax treatment is similar to that of stocks and bonds. \nCryptocurrency mining is also considered a taxable event. The fair market value or cost basis of the coin is its price at the time at which it was rewarded to you. The nature of those deductions differs based on whether you mined the cryptocurrencies for personal or business gain. \nIf you run a mining business, then you can make the deductions to cut down your tax bill. But you cannot make these deductions if you mined the cryptocurrencies for personal benefit. \nSome have argued that conversion of one cryptocurrency to another, say from Bitcoin to Ether, should be classified as a under Section 1031 of the . The IRS allows you to defer income tax on exchanges of like-kind property when they are exchanged for productive use in a business or investment. \nHowever, in a Memorandum from the Office of Chief Counsel released on June 18, 2021, the IRS ruled that such exchanges do not qualify as a like-kind exchange under Section 1031. What's more, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA) of 2017 put an end to that practice by clarifying that like-kind transfers are restricted to property transactions. \nIf you receive cryptocurrency in a transaction performed via an exchange, the value of the digital currency received is recorded by the exchange at the time of the transaction. If the transaction is performed outside of the exchange (P2P), the basis of the cryptocurrency is the fair market value at the time. \nHard forks of a cryptocurrency occur when a blockchain split occurs, meaning there is a change in protocols. This creates a taxable event if new cryptocurrencies are acquired because of it. For instance, imagine a blockchain was split, and a new coin, with differences in mining and use cases, was created. Holders of the original cryptocurrency are given new coins. This practice is called an airdrop and is also used as a marketing tactic by developers of new coins to induce demand and usage. \nIn a 2019 ruling, the IRS clarified that hard forks do not result in gross income, if the wallet holder does not receive units of cryptocurrency. Airdrops, on the other hand, qualify as gross income after the holder receives units of a new cryptocurrency either after a hard fork or by marketers of a coin. In the latter case, the quantity and time at which a crypto wallet holder receives the new coins determines the tax amount. Airdrops are taxed as ordinary income. \nA critical note here is the coins' value when you receive them. A new coin might be forked from Bitcoin, with the developers stating it has a certain value. However, just because the creators state this doesn't mean the airdropped crypto was worth it—it is worth whatever its fair market value was on that day because it is no longer Bitcoin, and cryptocurrency creators of non-security tokens do not dictate market value. A would likely be issued with a value because you're buying an asset being issued like a stock.\nCryptocurrency donations are treated similarly to cash donations. They are tax-deductible, though donors face limits on how much they can deduct based on their adjusted gross income. An appraiser will assign a fair market value for the coin based on its market price at the time of donation. The donor is not required to pay any taxes on the price gain. \nThe IRS established an annual . In 2023, taxpayers were allowed an annual exclusion per donee for a gift amount of up to $17,000. This limit was increased to $18,000 in 2024. \nThe volatility of Bitcoin's price makes it difficult to determine the fair value of the cryptocurrency on purchase and sale transactions. You should always track transactions as they occur, as retrospectively needing to obtain financial information (even on distributed ledgers) may prove to be difficult. \nThe only way to avoid paying Bitcoin taxes is to not sell or use any during the tax year. Receiving Bitcoin as an airdrop or in exchange for service has tax implications, but most taxable events are triggered by the sale or exchange of the cryptocurrency.\nAll centralized exchanges have \"Know Your Client\" reporting obligations in which investors must upload their photo identification and some personal information. If your trading platform provides you with a Form 1099-B or Form 1099-K, the IRS is informed that you have transacted with the trading platform.\nTax evasion occurs when taxpayers knowingly fail to report and pay taxes on any source of income, whether related to cryptocurrency, wages, salaries, stocks, real estate, or other investments. If the IRS has reason to believe you have engaged in tax fraud, it may audit you. Be mindful that trading platforms may issue tax statements notifying the IRS that you have engaged in cryptocurrency transactions.\nMost transactions trigger taxable events, and your Bitcoin's tax basis is usually the cost basis or fair market value at acquisition. Knowingly avoiding reporting income or gains is considered tax fraud. \nDid you know that 82% of Nvidia’s gains between March 2024 and February 2025 happened outside of regular Nasdaq hours?* on 100+ US shares 24 hours a day, meaning you never need to miss out when the markets move. for super-fast execution backed by dedicated support. 74-89% of retail CFD accounts lose money *Data from the Pepperstone platform. \nInvestopedia requires writers to use primary sources to support their work.

As a reward for temporarily delegating their assets to the blockchain networks, these asset owners and validators earn crypto through network rewards and fees directly from the networks.\nWhen you stake on Coinbase, Coinbase handles the validation process, pooling your staked coins with others and distributing network rewards to you. To learn more about how staking on Coinbase works, visit our . \nAlthough it’s unlikely, there is a possibility you could lose your staked assets due to a network or validator failure. However, no customer has lost crypto staking with Coinbase. As a publicly traded, audited company, Coinbase is to compliance with both regulators and the rules of the networks on which it stakes.\nYes, you can request to unstake anytime. Depending on the specific cryptocurrency, there may be a waiting period while your crypto is fully unstaked before you can withdraw your staked assets. You also may not be able to send your assets immediately while they are being unstaked.\nFor some assets, there is a waiting period before you can start earning rewards when you stake. Similarly, when you decide to unstake there may be a cooldown period during which you won't earn rewards. This could take from a few minutes to several weeks, depending on the asset. Coinbase displays the estimated withdrawal time when you stake your assets.\nIf you are new to Coinbase, you will need to your account, purchase or transfer in eligible staking assets, and then opt in to stake. If you are an existing customer, go to your to stake any eligible assets you already hold or buy eligible assets and opt in to staking. \nInformation provided on this Site is for general educational purposes only and is not intended to constitute investment or other advice on financial products.

If the block is approved by the validating nodes, the miner receives the block reward.\n\n\nImagine a global digital ledger where every cryptocurrency transaction is recorded. Mining ensures this ledger stays accurate and secure. Miners use specialized computers to solve puzzles (essentially guessing numbers) to organize and confirm pending transactions. The first one to solve it gets rewarded with cryptocurrency.\nlike bitcoin (BTC). It's the process by which user transactions are verified and added to the blockchain's public ledger. Mining is one of the critical elements that allows the Bitcoin network to be decentralized, meaning it’s able to work without a central authority.\nMining operations are also responsible for adding new coins to the existing supply. While this may sound like printing money, crypto mining follows a set of hard-coded rules that govern the process and prevent anyone from arbitrarily creating new coins. These rules are built into the underlying protocols and enforced by the distributed network of nodes.\nTo create new cryptocurrency units, miners use their computing power to solve complex cryptographic puzzles. The first miner to solve the puzzle earns the right to add a new block of transactions to the \n). Validating nodes are responsible for verifying the validity of transactions. The job of a miner is to collect these pending transactions and organize them into blocks. Note that some miners also run validating nodes, but mining nodes and validating nodes are technically different.\nYou can think of a block as a page of the blockchain ledger in which several transactions are recorded (along with other data). More specifically, a mining node is responsible for collecting unconfirmed transactions from the memory pool and assembling them into a \nThe miner then attempts to convert this candidate block into a confirmed block. To do this, they must solve a complex math problem that requires a lot of computing resources. However, for each successfully mined block, the miner receives a \nIn the context of mining, the hash of each transaction consists of a string of numbers and letters that acts as an identifier. The transaction hash represents all the information contained in that transaction.\nIn addition to hashing and listing each transaction individually, the miner also adds a custom transaction, in which they send themselves the block reward. This transaction is called the coinbase transaction and is what creates brand-new coins. In most cases, this transaction is the first to be recorded in a new block, followed by a group of pending transactions awaiting confirmation.\nThe new hash outputs are then organized into pairs and hashed again, and the process is repeated until a single hash is created. This last hash is known as the root hash (or Merkle root) and is basically the hash that represents all the previous hashes used to generate it.\nA block header acts as an identifier for each individual block, meaning each block has a unique hash. When creating a new block, miners combine the hash of the previous block with the root hash of their candidate block to generate a new block hash. They must also add an arbitrary number known as a nonce.\nSo, when trying to confirm their candidate block, a miner needs to combine the root hash, the previous block’s hash, and a nonce and put them all through a hash function. Their goal is to do this repeatedly until they can create a valid hash.\nThe root hash and the hash of the previous block cannot be changed, so miners must change the nonce value several times until a valid hash is found. In order to be considered valid, the output (block hash) must be less than a certain target value determined by the protocol. In Bitcoin mining, the block hash must start with a certain number of zeros — this target value is known as the mining \nAs we’ve seen, miners must hash the block header repeatedly using different nonce values. They do so until they find a valid block hash. When a miner finds a valid block hash, they broadcast this block to the network. Then, all other validating nodes will check if the block is valid and, if so, add the new block to their copy of the blockchain.\nAt this point, the candidate block becomes a confirmed block, and all miners move on to mine the next block. Miners who couldn’t find a valid hash on time discard their candidate block as a new mining race starts.\nSometimes, two miners broadcast a valid block at the same time, and the network ends up with two competing blocks. The miners then start mining the next block based on the block they received first, causing the network to split into two different versions of the blockchain temporarily.\nThe competition between these blocks continues until the next block is mined on top of one of the competing blocks. When a new block is mined, whichever block came before it is considered the winner. The block that is then abandoned is called an \nThe mining difficulty is regularly adjusted by the protocol to ensure a constant rate for new block creation, leading to a steady and predictable issuance of new coins. The difficulty adjusts in proportion to the amount of computational power (\nEvery time new miners join the network and competition grows, the hashing difficulty increases, which prevents the average block time from decreasing. Conversely, if many miners leave the network, the hashing difficulty decreases, making it easier to mine a new block. These adjustments keep the average block time constant, regardless of the network’s total hashing power.\nThere are several ways to mine cryptocurrencies. Equipment and processes change as new hardware and consensus algorithms emerge. Typically, miners use specialized computing units to solve complicated cryptographic equations. Let’s take a look at some of the most common mining methods.\nHowever, as more people began to mine BTC and the network’s hash rate increased, profitable mining became increasingly difficult. The advent of specialized mining hardware with greater processing power eventually made CPU mining nearly impossible. Today, CPU mining is likely no longer a viable option, as most miners use specialized hardware.\nGraphics Processing Units (GPUs) are designed to process a wide range of applications simultaneously. While they're typically used for video games or graphics rendering, they can also be used for mining.\nGPUs are relatively inexpensive and more flexible than highly specialized mining hardware. GPUs can be used to mine some altcoins, but their efficiency depends on the mining difficulty and algorithm.\nis designed to serve a single specific purpose. In crypto, the term refers to specialized hardware designed exclusively for mining. ASIC mining is known for being highly efficient, but it’s relatively expensive. \nBecause ASIC miners are at the forefront of mining technology, the cost of a unit is much higher than that of a CPU or GPU. In addition, the constant advancement of ASIC technology can quickly render older ASIC models unprofitable. This makes ASIC mining one of the most expensive ways to mine, but it’s the most efficient and can be profitable if done on a large scale.\nSince each block reward is given only to the first successful miner, the probability of mining a block is extremely low. Miners with a small percentage of the mining power have a very small chance of discovering the next block on their own. \nMining pools are groups of miners who pool their resources (hash power) to increase their chances of winning block rewards. When the pool successfully finds a block, the miners in the pool share the reward according to the amount of work they each contributed.\nprovider. It’s a simpler way to start mining, but it comes with risks like scams or lower profitability. If you decide to try cloud mining, make sure to choose a reputable provider like \nand was introduced in the Bitcoin whitepaper in 2008. In a nutshell, PoW determines how a blockchain network reaches consensus across all distributed participants without third-party intermediaries. It does so by requiring significant investments in electricity and computing power to disincentivize bad actors.\nAs we’ve seen, pending transactions on a PoW network are ordered and added into blocks by miners who compete to solve puzzles using specialized mining hardware. The first miner to find a valid solution can broadcast their block to the blockchain, and, if the validating nodes accept their block, the miner receives the block reward.\nThe amount of crypto in a block reward varies from one blockchain to another. For example, on the Bitcoin blockchain, miners can get 3.125 BTC in block reward as of December 2024. Due to Bitcoin’s \nWhile it is possible to make money mining cryptocurrency, it requires careful consideration, risk management, and research. It also involves investments and risks, such as hardware costs, cryptocurrency price volatility, and cryptocurrency protocol changes. To mitigate these risks, miners often engage in risk management practices while assessing potential costs and benefits.\nThe profitability of crypto mining depends on several factors. One of them is changes in cryptocurrency prices. When cryptocurrency prices increase, the fiat value of mining rewards also increases. Conversely, profitability can decline along with decreasing prices.\nThe efficiency of the mining hardware is also a crucial factor in determining mining profitability. Mining hardware can be expensive, so miners must balance the cost of the hardware with the potential rewards it can generate. Another factor to consider is the cost of electricity; if it's too high, it could outweigh earnings and make mining unprofitable.\nIn addition, mining hardware may need to be upgraded relatively often, as they tend to become obsolete rather quickly. New models will outperform old ones, and if miners lack the budget to upgrade their machines, they will likely struggle to remain competitive.\nLast but not least, significant changes may happen at the protocol level. For example, the halving of Bitcoin can affect mining profitability as it cuts the reward for mining a block in half. In other cases, the process of mining can be replaced by other validation methods. For example, \nMining has certain advantages and disadvantages. The most obvious advantage is the potential income from block rewards. However, this is influenced by a number of factors, including electricity costs and market prices.

Cryptocurrencies and the blockchain technology that powers them make it possible to transfer value online without the need for a middleman like a bank or credit card company.\n  * because it enables payments to be made between people who don’t know each other without having to go through a third-party verifier like a bank.\n  * Blockchain technology is also exciting because it has many uses beyond cryptocurrency. , improve the accuracy of healthcare records, streamline supply chains, and so much more. \n\n\n  * Because every single transaction on cryptocurrency networks is published publicly in the form of the blockchain, anyone can scrutinize them. That leaves no room for manipulation of transactions, changing the money supply, or adjusting the rules mid-game. The software that constitutes the core of these currencies is free and open-source so anyone can review the code. \n\n\nThink about how much of your financial life takes place online, from shopping to investing – and how every single one of those transactions requires a bank or a credit card company or payment processor like Paypal in the middle of it. Blockchains allow for those transactions to happen without a middleman, and without the added costs and complexity that come with them.\n\n\nPicture a chain you might use for a ship’s anchor. But in this case, every on the chain is a chunk of information that contains transaction data. At the top of the chain you see what happened today, and as you move down the chain you see older and older transactions. And if you follow it all the way down to the anchor sitting at the bottom of the harbor? You’ll have seen every single transaction in the history of that cryptocurrency. Which gives the blockchain powerful security advantages: it’s an open, transparent record of a cryptocurrency’s entire history. If anyone tries to manipulate a transaction it will cause the to break, and the entire network will see what happened. That, in a nutshell, is blockchain explained.\n  * (sometimes you’ll hear the terms ‘distributed ledger’ or ‘immutable ledger’), that is similar to the balance sheet of a bank. Like a bank’s ledger, the blockchain tracks all the money flowing into, out of, and through the network.\n  * But unlike a bank’s books, . In fact it isn’t centralized at all. Instead, it is maintained by a large peer-to-peer network of computers running open-source software. The network is constantly checking and securing the accuracy of the blockchain.\n  * Every so often – around every ten minutes in the case of Bitcoin – a new chunk of transaction information (or a new block) is added to the chain of existing information. In exchange for contributing their computing power to maintaining the blockchain, the network rewards participants with a small amount of digital currency.\n\n\nThe cryptocurrency network assigns each user a unique ‘address,’ which is made up of a private key and a public key. Anyone can send you money via your public key, which is akin to an email address. When you want to spend your money, you use your private key, which is basically your password, to digitally ‘sign’ transactions. A way to manage your cryptocurrency is via software called a wallet, which you can get via an exchange like Coinbase.\nA person or group using the name Satoshi Nakamoto published a whitepaper online explaining the principles behind a new kind of digital money called Bitcoin in late 2008. Every cryptocurrency since is an evolution of the ideas laid out in that paper.\n  * Nakamoto’s goal was to create digital money that would make online transactions between two strangers anywhere in the world possible without requiring a third party like a credit card company or a payment processor like Paypal in the middle.\n  * This required a system that would eliminate a thorny issue called the ‘double spending’ problem, where a person might use the same money more than once. The solution is a network that is constantly verifying the movement of Bitcoin. That network is the blockchain.\n  * The database that holds all of that information is called the blockchain. via that huge, decentralized (also known as peer-to-peer) network of computers, which are also constantly verifying and securing the accuracy of the blockchain. In exchange for contributing their computing power to the blockchain, miners are rewarded with small amounts of cryptocurrency.\n  * Bitcoin can’t exist separately from the blockchain; each new bitcoin is recorded on it, as is each subsequent transaction with all existing coins.\n\n\nThe blockchain idea has turned out to be a platform that a huge range of applications can be built on top of. It’s still a new and rapidly developing technology, but many experts have described blockchain’s potential to change the way we live and work as being similar to the potential public internet protocols like HTML had in the early days of the World Wide Web.\n  * The and blockchains work in a very similar way to the original Bitcoin blockchain. , because unlike the Bitcoin blockchain it’s not solely designed to manage a digital money. (That said is a cryptocurrency and certainly can be used to send value to another person). Think of the Ethereum blockchain more like a powerful and highly flexible computing platform that allows coders to build all kinds of applications leveraging the blockchain.\n  * For example, .

{"url": "https://www.coinbase.com/learn/crypto-basics/what-is-mining", "title": "What is mining? | Coinbase", "markdown": "Mining is the process that and several other cryptocurrencies use to generate new coins and verify new transactions. It involves vast, decentralized networks of computers around the world that verify and secure blockchains – the virtual ledgers that document cryptocurrency transactions. In return for contributing their processing power, computers on the network are rewarded with new coins. It’s a virtuous circle: the miners maintain and secure the blockchain, the blockchain awards the coins, the coins provide an incentive for the miners to maintain the blockchain.\nThere are three primary ways of obtaining bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. You can buy them on an exchange like Coinbase, receive them as payment for goods or services, or virtually “mine” them. It’s the third category that we’re explaining here, using as our example. \nYou might have considered trying bitcoin mining yourself. In Bitcoin's early years, anyone with a decent home computer could participate. But as the blockchain has grown, the computational power required to maintain it has increased. (By a : the computing power required to mine one Bitcoin in 2024 is vastly higher - around 6 times more - than when the first Bitcoin blocks were mined in 2009, due to the exponential growth in mining difficulty over the past 15 years as more miners have joined the network.) \nAs a result, amateur bitcoin mining hasn't typically been profitable for hobbyists in years. Virtually all mining is now done by specialized companies or groups of people who band their resources together. But it’s still good to know how it works.\n  * Specialized computers perform the calculations required to verify and record every new bitcoin transaction and ensure that the blockchain is secure. Verifying the blockchain requires a vast amount of computing power, which is voluntarily contributed by miners. \n  * Bitcoin mining is a lot like running a big data center. Companies purchase the mining hardware and pay for the electricity required to keep it running (and cool). For this to be profitable, the value of the earned coins has to be higher than the cost to mine those coins.\n  * What motivates miners? The network holds a lottery. Every computer on the network races to be the first to guess a 64-digit hexadecimal number known as a “hash.” The faster a computer can spit out guesses, the more likely the miner is to earn the reward. \n  * The winner updates the blockchain ledger with all the newly verified transactions – thereby adding a newly verified “block” containing all those transactions to the chain – and is granted a predetermined amount of newly minted bitcoin. (On average, this happens every ten minutes.) As of April 2024, the reward is 3.125 bitcoin per block, and as the difficulty of mining increases with each , the reward will keep decreasing until no more bitcoins are left to be mined.\n  * There will only ever be 21 million bitcoin. The final block should theoretically be mined in 2140. From that point forward, miners will no longer rely on newly issued bitcoin as reward, but instead will rely on the fees they charge for making transactions.\n\n\nBeyond releasing new coins into circulation, mining is central to (and many other cryptocurrencies’) security. It verifies and secures the blockchain, which allows cryptocurrencies to function as a peer-to-peer decentralized network without any need for oversight from a third party. And it creates the incentive for miners to contribute their computing power to the network.\nInformation provided on this Site is for general educational purposes only and is not intended to constitute investment or other advice on financial products.
