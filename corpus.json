      "markdown": "At its core, cryptocurrency is . Bitcoin, which launched in 2008, was the first cryptocurrency, and it remains by far the biggest, most influential, and best-known. In the decade since, and other cryptocurrencies like have grown as digital alternatives to money issued by governments.\n  * The most popular cryptocurrencies, by market capitalization, are. Other well-known cryptocurrencies include , , and . Some are similar to Bitcoin. Others are based on different technologies, or have new features that allow them to do more than transfer value.\n  * . They’re managed by peer-to-peer networks of computers running free, open-source software. Generally, anyone who wants to participate is able to.\n  * Each currency has its own blockchain, which is an ongoing, constantly re-verified record of every single transaction ever made using that currency.\n  * No company, country, or third party is in control of it; and anyone can participate. A blockchain is a breakthrough technology only recently made possible through decades of computer science and mathematical innovations.\n\n\nWhen paying with cryptocurrency, you don’t need to provide unnecessary personal information to the merchant. Which means your financial information is protected from being shared with third parties like banks, payment services, advertisers, and credit-rating agencies. And because no sensitive information needs to be sent over the internet, there is very little risk of your financial information being compromised, or your identity being stolen.\nAlmost all cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin and Ethereum are secured using technology called a blockchain, which is constantly checked and verified by a decentralized network of miners or validators (through mechanisms such as ).\nBecause your cryptocurrency holdings aren’t tied to a financial institution or government, they are available to you no matter where you are in the world or what happens to any of the global finance system’s major intermediaries.\nEvery transaction on the Bitcoin, Ethereum, Tezos, and Bitcoin Cash networks is published publicly, without exception. This means there's no room for manipulation of transactions, changing the money supply, or adjusting the rules mid-game.\nUnlike a credit card payment, cryptocurrency payments can’t be reversed. For merchants, this hugely reduces the likelihood of being defrauded. For customers, it has the potential to make commerce cheaper by eliminating one of the major arguments credit card companies make for their high processing fees.\nThe network powering Bitcoin has never been hacked. And the fundamental ideas behind cryptocurrencies help make them safe: the systems are permissionless and the core software is open-source, meaning countless computer scientists and cryptographers have been able to examine all aspects of the networks and their security.\nCryptocurrencies are , and have powerful advantages over previous payment methods and traditional classes of assets. Think of them as Money 2.0. -- a new kind of cash that is native to the internet, which gives it the potential to be the fastest, easiest, cheapest, safest, and most universal way to exchange value that the world has ever seen.\n  * , but they can’t be manipulated by any central authority, simply because there isn’t one. No matter what happens to a government, your cryptocurrency will remain secure.\n\n\n  * Digital currencies provide , regardless of where you were born or where you live. As long as you have a smartphone or another internet-connected device, you have the same crypto access as everyone else.\n\n\n  * Cryptocurrencies create unique opportunities for expanding people’s . Digital currencies’ essential borderlessness facilitates free trade, even in countries with tight government controls over citizens’ finances. In places where inflation is a key problem, cryptocurrencies can provide an alternative to dysfunctional fiat currencies for savings and payments.\n  * As part of a broader investment strategy, crypto can be approached in a wide variety of ways. Another would be a more active strategy, buying and selling cryptocurrencies that experience volatility.\n  * , which is pegged 1:1 to the value of the U.S. dollar. It offers the benefits of crypto, including the ability to transfer money internationally quickly and cheaply, with the stability of a traditional currency. Coinbase customers that hold earn rewards, making it an appealing alternative to a traditional savings account.\n\n\n\nUSD Coin is an example of a cryptocurrency called stablecoins. You can think of these as crypto dollars—they’re designed to minimize volatility and maximize utility. .\n  * As a result, their valuations are less likely to shift dramatically from day to day. That stability can increase their utility for everyday use as money, because over a longer timeframe.\n\n\nExperts often talk about the ways crypto can provide solutions to the shortcomings of our current financial system. High fees, identity theft, and extreme economic inequality are an unfortunate part of our current financial system and they’re also things cryptocurrencies have the potential to address. The technology that powers digital currencies also has wide-ranging potential beyond the financial industry, from revolutionizing supply chains to building the new, decentralized internet.\nBitcoin is the first and most well-known, but there are thousands of types of cryptocurrencies. Many, like and , share Bitcoin’s core characteristics but explore new ways to process transactions. Others offer a wider range of features. , for example, can be used to run applications and create contracts. All four, however, are based on an idea called , which is \n  * At its most basic, a blockchain is a list of transactions that anyone can view and verify. . This list of transactions is fundamental for most cryptocurrencies because it enables secure payments to be made between people who don’t know each other without having to go through a third-party verifier like a bank.\n  * Blockchain technology is also exciting because it has many uses beyond cryptocurrency. , increase privacy on the internet, and so much more.\n  * The blockchain ledger is split across all the computers on the network, which are constantly verifying that the blockchain is accurate.This means .\n\n\nto transfer coin ownership on a secure and distributed ledger. A private key is an ultra secure password that never needs to be shared with anyone, with which you can send value on the network. An associated public key can be freely and safely shared with others to receive value on the network. From the public key, it is impossible for anyone to guess your private key.\nBitcoin is ‘mined’ via a decentralized (also known as peer-to-peer) network of computers. But mining doesn’t just generate more bitcoin - it’s also the mechanism that updates and secures the network by constantly verifying the public blockchain ledger and adding new transactions.\n  * Technically, . But before you get excited, it’s worth noting that mining is not always profitable. Depending on which cryptocurrency you’re mining, how fast your computer is, and the cost of electricity in your area, you may end up spending more on mining than you earn back in cryptocurrency.\n  * Again, taking Bitcoin as an example, the network holds a lottery in which all the mining rigs around the world race to become the first to solve a math problem, which also verifies and updates the blockchain with new transactions. Each winner is awarded new bitcoin, which can then make its way into the broader marketplace.\n\n\nSupply refers to how much is available—like how many bitcoin are available to buy at any moment in time. Demand refers to people’s desire to own it—as in how many people want to buy bitcoin and how strongly they want it. The value of a cryptocurrency will always be a balance of both factors.\nThere are also other types of value. For example, there’s the value you get from using a cryptocurrency. Many people enjoy spending or gifting crypto, meaning that it gives them a sense of pride to support an exciting new financial system. Similarly, some people like to shop with bitcoin because they like its low fees and want to encourage businesses to accept it.\n  *   * One good approach is to ask yourself what you’re hoping to do with crypto and choose the currency that will help you achieve your goals. For example, . On the other hand, if you want to play a digital card game, then Ethereum is a popular choice.\n  * . On Coinbase, you can buy portions of coins in increments as little as 2 dollars, euros, pounds, or your local currency.\n\n\nStoring crypto is similar to storing cash, which means you need to protect it from theft and loss. There are many ways to store crypto both online and off, but the simplest solution is via a trusted, secure exchange like Coinbase.\n  * The Coinbase app makes it as easy as transferring funds from one bank to another. (Much like conventional bank transfers or ATM withdrawals, exchanges like Coinbase set a daily limit, and it might take from a few days to a week for the transaction to be completed.\n\n\nThere’s a wide range of things you can do with cryptocurrency, and the list grows with time. :\n  * : Authors, musicians, and other online content creators sometimes leave Bitcoin addresses or QR codes at the end of their articles. If you like their work, you can give a little crypto as a way of saying thanks.\n  * : Orchid is a VPN, which helps protect you when you’re online, and a digital currency at the same time. Basically it’s broken down into two parts, the Orchid VPN app and the OXT cryptocurrency, and it all runs on the Ethereum network. Intrigued? .\n  * the world: Because cryptocurrency isn’t tied to a specific country, traveling with crypto can cut down on money exchange fees. There’s already a small but thriving community of self-titled “crypto nomads” who primarily, or in some cases exclusively, spend crypto when they travel.\n  * : Decentraland, which also runs on the Ethereum blockchain, is the first virtual world entirely owned by its users. Users can buy and sell land, avatar clothing, and all kinds of other stuff while partying in virtual nightclubs or mingling in virtual art galleries.\n  * : A wide variety of new players are aiming to recreate the entire global financial system, from mutual-fund-like investments to loan-lending mechanisms and way beyond, without any central authorities.\n\n\nInformation provided on this Site is for general educational purposes only and is not intended to constitute investment or other advice on financial products.

It’s an appealingly simple concept: is digital money that allows for secure peer-to-peer transactions on the internet.\n  * Unlike services like Venmo and PayPal, which rely on the traditional financial system for permission to transfer money and on existing debit/credit accounts, is decentralized: any two people, anywhere in the world, can send bitcoin to each other without the involvement of a bank, government, or other institution.\n  * Every transaction involving Bitcoin is tracked on the , which is similar to a bank’s ledger, or log of customers’ funds going in and out of the bank. In simple terms, it’s a record of every transaction ever made using bitcoin.\n  * Unlike a bank’s ledger, the Bitcoin blockchain is distributed across the entire network. No company, country, or third party is in control of it; and anyone can become part of that network.\n\n\nOne BTC was valued at a fraction of a U.S. penny in early 2010. During the first quarter of 2011, it exceeded a dollar. In late 2017, its value skyrocketed, topping out at close to $20,000, and Bitcoin ended up topping $64,899 in November 2021. You can track the price of bitcoin .\n  * Unlike government-issued currencies such as the dollar or euro, Bitcoin allows online transfers without a middleman such as a bank or payment processor. The removal of those gatekeepers creates a whole range of new possibilities, including the potential for money to move around the global internet more quickly and cheaply, and allowing individuals to have maximum control over their own assets.\n  * It’s been used as a medium of exchange, a store of value, and a unit of account—which are all properties of money. Meanwhile, it only exists digitally; there is no physical version of it.\n\n\nTo really grasp how bitcoin works, it helps to start at the beginning. The question of who created bitcoin is a fascinating one, because a decade after inventing the technology—and despite a lot of digging by journalists and members of the crypto community—its creator remains anonymous.\n  * This paper wasn’t the first idea for digital money drawing on the fields of cryptography and computer science—in fact, the paper referred to earlier concepts—but , where people may be hidden (like bitcoin’s own creator) by pseudonyms, or physically located on the other side of the planet.\n  * : the bitcoin private key and the blockchain ledger. When you hold bitcoin, you control it through a private key—a string of randomized numbers and letters that unlocks a virtual vault containing your purchase. Each private key is tracked on the virtual ledger called the blockchain.\n\n\n, because it solved a fundamental problem of commerce on the internet: how do you transfer value between two people without a trusted intermediary (like a bank) in the middle? By solving that problem, the invention of bitcoin has wide-ranging ramifications: As a currency designed for the internet, it allows for financial transactions that range across borders and around the globe without the involvement of banks, credit-card companies, lenders, or even governments. When any two people—wherever they might live—can send payments to each other without encountering those gatekeepers, it creates the potential for an open financial system that is more efficient, more free, and more innovative. That, in a nutshell, is bitcoin explained.\nUnlike credit card networks like Visa and payment processors like Paypal, bitcoin is not owned by an individual or company. Bitcoin is the world’s first completely open payment network which anyone with an internet connection can participate in. Bitcoin was designed to be used on the internet, and doesn’t depend on banks or private companies to process transactions.\nOne of the most important elements of Bitcoin is the blockchain, which tracks who owns what, similar to how a bank tracks assets. What sets the Bitcoin blockchain apart from a bank's ledger is that it is decentralized, meaning anyone can view it and no single entity controls it.\n  * In the early days, a typical desktop PC was powerful enough to participate, which allowed pretty much anyone who was curious to try their hand at mining. These days the computers required are massive, specialized, and often owned by businesses or large numbers of individuals pooling their resources. (In October 2019, it required 12 trillion times more computing power to mine one bitcoin than it did when Nakamoto mined the first blocks in January 2009.)\n\n\n  * Bitcoin is inextricably tied to the blockchain; each new bitcoin is recorded on it, as is each subsequent transaction with all existing coins.\n  * The Bitcoin network holds a continuous lottery in which all the mining rigs around the world race to be the first to solve a math problem. Every 10 min or so, a winner is found, and the winner updates the Bitcoin ledger with new valid transactions. The prize changes over time, but in May 2020, the reward for each winner of this raffle went from 12.5 bitcoin per block to 6.25, and in 2024, with the , this reward further dropped from 6.25 to 3.125 as a mechanism to increase scarcity.\n  * At the beginning, a bitcoin was technically worthless. At the end of 2019, it was trading at around $7,500, and in November 2021, it topped $64,000. One bitcoin is currently divisible to eight decimal places (100 millionths of one bitcoin); the bitcoin community refers to the smallest unit as a ‘Satoshi.’\n  * . As of December 2023, there were around 1,4 million bitcoins still available to be mined. The last blocks will theoretically be mined in 2140.\n\n\nCryptocurrencies and traditional currencies share some traits — like how you can use them to buy things or how you can transfer them electronically — but they’re also different in interesting ways. Here are a few highlights.\nEssentially the same way a traditional currency does – because it’s proven itself to be a viable and convenient way to store value, which means it can easily be traded for goods, services, or other assets. It’s scarce, secure, portable (compared to, say, gold), and easily divisible, allowing transactions of all sizes.\nThe easiest way to buy bitcoin is to purchase it through an online exchange like Coinbase. Coinbase makes it easy to buy, sell, send, receive, and store bitcoin without needing to hold it yourself using something called public and private keys.\n  1. Each person who joins the bitcoin network is issued a , which is a long string of letters and numbers that you can think of like an email address, and a private key, which is equivalent to a password.\n  2. When you buy bitcoin—or send/receive it—you get a public key, which you can think of as a key that unlocks a virtual vault and gives you access to your money.\n  3. Anyone can send bitcoin to you via your public key, but only the holder of the private key can access the bitcoin in the “virtual vault” once it’s been sent.\n  4. If you want to transfer money from to a bank account after selling your bitcoin, . Similar to conventional bank transfers or ATM withdrawals, exchanges like Coinbase set a daily limit, and it may take between a few days and a week for the transaction to be completed.\n\n\nAll bitcoin transactions and public keys are recorded on a virtual ledger called the blockchain. The ledger is effectively a chronological list of transactions. This ledger is copied—exactly—across every computer that is connected to the bitcoin network, and it is constantly checked and secured using a vast amount of computing power across the globe. The blockchain concept has turned out to be powerful and adaptable, and there are now a wide variety of non-cryptocurrency-related blockchains that are used for things like supply-chain management. The ‘Bitcoin Blockchain’ specifically refers to the virtual ledger that records bitcoin transactions and private keys.\nBack in 2013, a bitcoin enthusiast named Laszlo Hanyecz created a message-board post offering 10,000 BTC – which then was worth around $25 – to anyone who would deliver two pizzas to his Jacksonville, Florida, home. As the legend goes, those two pizzas, which another bitcoin early-adopter bought from a local Papa John’s, marked the first successful purchase of non-virtual goods using bitcoin. Thankfully it’s a lot easier to use bitcoin these days!\n  * : Transactions using BTC aren’t that different from those using a credit or debit card, but instead of being asked to enter card info, you’ll simply be entering the payment amount and the vendor’s public key (similar to an email address) via a wallet app. (When transacting in person using smartphones or tablets, often a QR code will pop up to simplify the process – when you scan the code, your wallet app will automatically enter the pertinent information.)\n  * : One of the benefits of paying with bitcoin is that doing so limits the amount of personal information you need to provide. The only time you need to share your name and address is if you’re purchasing physical goods that need to be shipped.\n  *     * And if you have a serious budget and unfulfilled astronaut dreams? Richard Branson’s Virgin Galactic happily accepts BTC in exchange for the opportunity to blast off on one of its forthcoming space-tourism missions.\n\n\n. You can send it across the planet as easily as you can pay with cash in the physical world. It isn't closed on weekends, doesn’t charge you a fee to access your money, and doesn't impose any arbitrary limits.\n. Bitcoin is like cash, in the sense that transactions cannot be reversed by the sender. In comparison, credit cards, conventional online payment systems, and banking transactions can be reversed after the payment has been made—sometimes months after the initial transaction—due to the centralized intermediaries that complete the transactions. This creates higher fraud risk for merchants, which can lead to higher fees for using credit cards.\n. When paying with bitcoin, there are no bank statements, or any need to provide unnecessary personal information to the merchant. Bitcoin transactions don’t contain any identifying information other than the bitcoin addresses and amounts involved.\n. Due to the cryptographic nature of the Bitcoin network, bitcoin payments are fundamentally more secure than standard debit/credit card transactions. When making a bitcoin payment, no sensitive information is required to be sent over the internet. There is a very low risk of your financial information being compromised, or having your identity stolen.\n. Every transaction on the Bitcoin network is published publicly, without exception. This means there's no room for manipulation of transactions (save for a highly unlikely 51% attack scenario) or changing the supply of bitcoin. The software that constitutes the core of Bitcoin is free and open-source so anyone can review the code.\n. In more than ten years of existence, the bitcoin network has never been successfully hacked. And because the system is permissionless and open-sourced, countless computer scientists and cryptographers have been able to examine all aspects of the network and its security.\nBitcoin is virtually ‘mined’ by a vast, decentralized (also referred to as ‘peer-to-peer’) network of computers that are constantly verifying and securing the accuracy of the blockchain. Every single bitcoin transaction is reflected on that ledger, with new information periodically gathered together in a “block,” which is added to all the blocks that came before.\nInformation provided on this Site is for general educational purposes only and is not intended to constitute investment or other advice on financial products.

The software that constitutes the core of these currencies is free and open-source so anyone can review the code. \n\n\nThink about how much of your financial life takes place online, from shopping to investing – and how every single one of those transactions requires a bank or a credit card company or payment processor like Paypal in the middle of it. Blockchains allow for those transactions to happen without a middleman, and without the added costs and complexity that come with them.\n\n\nPicture a chain you might use for a ship’s anchor. But in this case, every on the chain is a chunk of information that contains transaction data. At the top of the chain you see what happened today, and as you move down the chain you see older and older transactions. And if you follow it all the way down to the anchor sitting at the bottom of the harbor? You’ll have seen every single transaction in the history of that cryptocurrency. Which gives the blockchain powerful security advantages: it’s an open, transparent record of a cryptocurrency’s entire history. If anyone tries to manipulate a transaction it will cause the to break, and the entire network will see what happened. That, in a nutshell, is blockchain explained.\n  * (sometimes you’ll hear the terms ‘distributed ledger’ or ‘immutable ledger’), that is similar to the balance sheet of a bank. Like a bank’s ledger, the blockchain tracks all the money flowing into, out of, and through the network.\n  * But unlike a bank’s books, . In fact it isn’t centralized at all. Instead, it is maintained by a large peer-to-peer network of computers running open-source software. The network is constantly checking and securing the accuracy of the blockchain.\n  * Every so often – around every ten minutes in the case of Bitcoin – a new chunk of transaction information (or a new block) is added to the chain of existing information. In exchange for contributing their computing power to maintaining the blockchain, the network rewards participants with a small amount of digital currency.\n\n\nThe cryptocurrency network assigns each user a unique ‘address,’ which is made up of a private key and a public key. Anyone can send you money via your public key, which is akin to an email address. When you want to spend your money, you use your private key, which is basically your password, to digitally ‘sign’ transactions. A way to manage your cryptocurrency is via software called a wallet, which you can get via an exchange like Coinbase.\nA person or group using the name Satoshi Nakamoto published a whitepaper online explaining the principles behind a new kind of digital money called Bitcoin in late 2008. Every cryptocurrency since is an evolution of the ideas laid out in that paper.\n  * Nakamoto’s goal was to create digital money that would make online transactions between two strangers anywhere in the world possible without requiring a third party like a credit card company or a payment processor like Paypal in the middle.\n  * This required a system that would eliminate a thorny issue called the ‘double spending’ problem, where a person might use the same money more than once. The solution is a network that is constantly verifying the movement of Bitcoin. That network is the blockchain.\n  * The database that holds all of that information is called the blockchain. via that huge, decentralized (also known as peer-to-peer) network of computers, which are also constantly verifying and securing the accuracy of the blockchain. In exchange for contributing their computing power to the blockchain, miners are rewarded with small amounts of cryptocurrency.\n  * Bitcoin can’t exist separately from the blockchain; each new bitcoin is recorded on it, as is each subsequent transaction with all existing coins.\n\n\nThe blockchain idea has turned out to be a platform that a huge range of applications can be built on top of. It’s still a new and rapidly developing technology, but many experts have described blockchain’s potential to change the way we live and work as being similar to the potential public internet protocols like HTML had in the early days of the World Wide Web.\n  * The and blockchains work in a very similar way to the original Bitcoin blockchain. , because unlike the Bitcoin blockchain it’s not solely designed to manage a digital money. (That said is a cryptocurrency and certainly can be used to send value to another person). Think of the Ethereum blockchain more like a powerful and highly flexible computing platform that allows coders to build all kinds of applications leveraging the blockchain.\n  * For example, . Or maybe you’re a video game developer that wants to create items like swords and armor that can be traded outside of the game itself? Ethereum is designed to do that, too.\n\n\nInformation provided on this Site is for general educational purposes only and is not intended to constitute investment or other advice on financial products.

It is also a decentralized computing platform that can run a wide variety of applications — including the entire universe of DeFi.\n, which launched in 2015, is the second-biggest cryptocurrency by after . But unlike , it wasn’t created to be digital money. Instead, ’s founders set out to build a new kind of global, decentralized computing platform that takes the security and openness of and extends those attributes to a vast range of applications. \nEverything from financial tools and games to complex databases are already running on the blockchain. And its future potential is only limited by developers’ imaginations. As the nonprofit Ethereum Foundation puts it: “Ethereum can be used to codify, decentralize, secure and trade just about anything.” \n  * The Ethereum blockchain : everything from games and advanced databases to complex decentralized financial instruments — meaning that they don’t require a bank or any other institution in the middle. \n  * Ethereum-based apps are , like regular paper contracts, establish the terms of an arrangement between parties. But unlike an old-fashioned contract, smart contracts automatically execute when the terms are met without the need for either participating party to know who is on the other side of the deal — and without the need for any kind of intermediary. \n  * Ethereum, like Bitcoin,Anyone with an internet connection can run an Ethereum node or interact with the network.\n  * Much like Bitcoin’s decentralized blockchain allows any two strangers, anywhere in the world, to send or receive money without a bank in the middle, smart contracts running on Ethereum’s decentralized blockchain. \n\n\nEthereum is the name of the network. “Ether” is the native cryptocurrency token used by the Ethereum network. That said, in day-to-day usage most people call the token “ETH” (or just “Ethereum”). As a way of sending, receiving, or storing value ETH works much like Bitcoin. But it also has a special role on the Ethereum network. Because users pay fees in ETH to execute smart contracts, you can think of it as the fuel that keeps the whole thing running (which is why those fees are called “gas”).\nThe fundamental ideas behind cryptocurrencies help make them safe: the systems are permissionless and the core software is open-source, meaning countless computer scientists and cryptographers have been able to examine all aspects of the networks and their security. \nApps on the Ethereum blockchain, however, are only guaranteed to be as secure as their developers have made them. For example, code can sometimes contain bugs that could result in loss of funds. While their source code is also visible to all, the user bases of each individual app are much smaller than Ethereum’s as a whole, and so fewer eyes are on them. It’s important to do research on any decentralized app you plan to use. \nYou might have heard that the Bitcoin blockchain is a lot like a bank’s ledger, or even a checkbook. It’s a running tally of every transaction made on the network going back to the very beginning — and the entire network works together to ensure that the tally is accurate and secure.\nThe Ethereum blockchain, on the other hand, is more like a computer: While it also does the work of documenting and securing transactions, it’s much more flexible than the Bitcoin blockchain. Developers can use the Ethereum blockchain to build a huge variety of tools — everything from logistics management software to games to the entire universe of DeFi applications (which span lending, borrowing, trading, and more).\n  * Ethereum uses a 'virtual machine' to achieve all this, which is like a giant, global computer made up of many individual computers running the Ethereum software. Keeping all of those computers running involves investment in both hardware and electricity by participants. To cover those costs, the network uses its own Bitcoin-like cryptocurrency called Ether (or, more commonly, ETH).\n  * ETH keeps the whole thing running. You interact with the Ethereum network by using ETH to pay the network to execute smart contracts. As a result, the fees paid in ETH are called “gas.”\n  * Gas rates vary depending on how busy the network is. A new version of the Ethereum blockchain called Ethereum 2.0, which aims to increase efficiency, was implemented in September 2022.\n\n\nEthereum 2.0 (often referred to as ETH2) is a major upgrade to the Ethereum network. It’s been designed to allow the Ethereum network to grow while increasing security, speed, and efficiency, and was implemented in September 2022, merging the original blockchain with the ETH2 blockchain.\nMoving a popular cryptoasset to a new platform is a complex endeavor, but for Ethereum to scale and evolve, it needed to happen. That’s because the “Proof of Work” method used by the ETH 1.0 blockchain to verify transactions caused bottlenecks, increased fees, and consumed substantial resources (particularly electricity).\nHow do cryptocurrency networks make sure that nobody spends the same money twice without a central authority like Visa or Paypal in the middle? They use a consensus mechanism. When ETH 1.0 launched, it adopted the consensus mechanism pioneered by Bitcoin: the aptly named Proof of Work. \n  * Proof of Work requires a huge amount of processing power, which is contributed by virtual “” around the world who compete to be the first to solve a time-consuming math puzzle. \n  * This process happens every 30 seconds (compared to Bitcoin’s approximately 10-minute cadence). As traffic on the network has increased, the limitations of Proof of Work have caused bottlenecks during which fees spike unpredictably.\n\n\nEthereum’s founders were aware of Proof of Work’s limitations. So a very different solution was devised for Ethereum 2.0. — one that will ultimately allow the network to efficiently process thousands of Ethereum transactions a second.\n, which is faster, less resource-intensive, and (at least theoretically) more secure. The end result is similar to Proof of Work’s, in that a network participant is chosen to verify the latest transactions, update the blockchain, and earn some ETH. \n  * The act of contributing ETH to the pool is called . If you choose to stake some of your ETH, you will earn rewards in proportion to the size of your stake. \n  * The network selects a winner based on the amount of ETH each validator has in the pool and the length of time they’ve had it there — literally . \n  * Once the winner has validated the latest block of transactions, other validators can attest that the block is accurate. When a threshold number of these attestations have been made, the network updates the blockchain. \n\n\nwere first in the 1990s by a computer scientist and lawyer named Nick Szabo. Imagine a machine that sells cans of soda for a quarter. If you put a dollar into the machine and select a soda, the machine is hardwired to either produce your drink and 75 cents in change, or (if your choice is sold out) to prompt you to make another selection or get your dollar back. This is an example of a simple smart contract. Just like a soda machine can automate a sale without a human intermediary, smart contracts can automate virtually any kind of exchange. \nHowever you acquire your ETH, you’ll need to understand a few basic concepts. Every address on the Ethereum network is issued a public key and a private key, and you’ll need a wallet to manage your crypto holdings. \n  * : Think of this like your password. You should generally avoid giving this out to people. A is a long string of letters and numbers. (It can also be in the form of a series of words called a .) It’s crucial to keep track of your private keys. If you lose them, you lose your Ether forever. \n  * : To store and secure your Ether you’ll need a . If you’re just starting out, the easiest option is to make an account via the or coinbase.com — in which case you’ll interact with a “custodial wallet” that stores and secures your private keys for you. As you progress you might want to investigate other wallet options that are built for interacting with decentralized finance (or DeFi) protocols such as Compound (a lending and savings app) or (a decentralized exchange that allows you to trade cryptocurrencies).\n\n\nThere are a few ways of thinking about the answer to this question. On one level, Ethereum’s value is set by markets like any other asset. People buy it with Bitcoin, dollars, euros, yen, and other currencies 24 hours a day. Depending on demand, the price can fluctuate from day to day. (Ethereum’s value tends to be volatile compared to currencies such as the US dollar or equities like Fortune 500 stocks because it is still an emerging technology.)\nBut the market prices it the way it does is a much more complicated question. To many investors Ethereum’s value is based on its flexibility as a platform for issuing stablecoins and running DeFi applications — resulting in a growing user base and growing transaction fees. \nInformation provided on this Site is for general educational purposes only and is not intended to constitute investment or other advice on financial products.

      "markdown": "A smart contract, like any contract, establishes the terms of an agreement. But unlike a traditional contract, a smart contract’s terms are executed as code running on a blockchain like Ethereum. Smart contracts allow developers to build apps that take advantage of blockchain security, reliability, and accessibility while offering sophisticated peer-to-peer functionality — everything from loans and insurance to logistics and gaming.\nJust like any contract, smart contracts lay out the terms of an agreement or deal. What makes smart contracts “smart,” however, is that the terms are established and executed as code running on a blockchain, rather than on paper sitting on a lawyer’s desk. Smart contracts expand on the basic idea behind — sending and receiving money without a “trusted intermediary” like a bank in the middle — to make it possible to securely automate and decentralize virtually any kind of deal or transaction, no matter how complex. And because they run on a blockchain like , they offer , reliability, and borderless accessibility.\nSmart contracts allow developers to build a wide variety of decentralized apps and tokens. They’re used in everything from new financial tools to logistics and game experiences, and they’re stored on a blockchain like any other crypto transaction. Once a smart-contract app has been added to the blockchain, it generally can’t be reversed or changed (although there are some exceptions).\nSmart-contract-powered apps are often referred to as “decentralized applications” or “dapps” – and they include decentralized finance (or DeFi) tech that aims to transform the banking industry. allow cryptocurrency holders to engage in complex financial transactions — saving, loans, insurance — without a bank or other financial institution taking a cut and from anywhere in the world. Some of the more popular current smart-contract powered applications include:\n  * : A cryptocurrency that is pegged via smart contract to the US dollar, making one worth one U.S. dollar. UDDC is part of a newer category of digital money known as .\n\n\nSo how would you use these smart contract-powered tools? Imagine you’re holding some that you’d like to trade for . You could put some into , which, via smart contract, can automatically find you the best exchange rate, make the trade, and send you your USDC. You could then put some of your USDC into Compound to lend to others and receive an algorithmically determined rate of interest — all without using a bank or other financial institution. \nIn traditional finance, swapping currencies is expensive and time consuming. And it isn't easy or secure for individuals to loan out their liquid assets to strangers on the other side of the world. But smart contracts make both of those scenarios, and a vast variety of others, possible.\nSmart contracts were first in the 1990s by a computer scientist and lawyer named Nick Szabo. Szabo famously compared a smart contract to a vending machine. Imagine a machine that sells cans of soda for a quarter. If you put a dollar into the machine and select a soda, the machine is hardwired to either produce your drink and 75 cents in change, or (if your choice is sold out) to prompt you to make another selection or get your dollar back. This is an example of a simple smart contract. Just like a soda machine can automate a sale without a human intermediary, smart contracts can automate virtually any kind of exchange.\nCurrently, Ethereum is the most popular smart contract platform, but many other cryptocurrency blockchains (including EOS, Neo, Tezos, , , and ) can run them. A smart contract can be created and deployed to a blockchain by anyone. Their code is transparent and publicly verifiable, which means that any interested party can see exactly what logic a smart contract follows when it receives digital assets.\n  * Smart contracts are written in a variety of programming languages (including Solidity, Web Assembly, and Michelson). On the Ethereum network, each smart contract’s code is stored on the blockchain, allowing any interested party to inspect the contract’s code and current state to verify its functionality. \n  * When a smart contract receives funds from a user, its code is executed by all nodes in the network in order to reach a consensus about the outcome and resulting flow of value. This is what allows smart contracts to securely run without any central authority, even when users are making complex financial transactions with unknown entities.\n  * Once deployed onto a blockchain, smart contracts generally can’t be altered, even by their creator. (There are exceptions to this rule.) This helps ensure that they can’t be censored or shut down. \n\n\nInformation provided on this Site is for general educational purposes only and is not intended to constitute investment or other advice on financial products.

      "markdown": "Cryptography is the study and practice of sending secure, encrypted messages between two or more parties. Cryptography allows digital currency transactions to be pseudonymous, secure, and “trustless” – with no bank or other intermediary required.\nThe “crypto” in the word “cryptocurrency” means “secret” in Greek – which gives you a clue as to what the field of cryptography is all about. Cryptography is the study and practice of sending secure, encrypted messages or data between two or more parties. The sender “encrypts” the message, which obscures its content to a third party, and the receiver “decrypts” the message, making it legible again. \nCryptocurrencies use cryptography to allow transactions to be anonymous, secure, and “trustless,” which means you don’t need to know anything about a person to safely make transactions with them – and you don’t need bank, credit-card company, government, or any other third party in the middle. And cryptography isn’t just important for digital money — our computer and the networks it’s attached to are encrypting and decrypting data constantly, from every Google search you make to every email you send.\nCryptocurrencies are entirely based on cryptographic ideas. was invented by a pseudonymous person (or group of people) going by the name of Satoshi Nakamoto, who proposed the idea in the form of a whitepaper posted to a cryptography message board in 2009. \nThe thorniest issue that Nakamoto solved was something called the double-spend problem. Because is just code, what’s to stop a person from making and spending multiple copies of their money? Nakamoto’s solution was based on a well-known encryption arrangement known as public-private key encryption. \n(as well as and many other cryptocurrencies) uses a technology called public-private key encryption. This allows them to be “trustless” – and makes secure transactions between strangers possible without a “trusted intermediary” like a bank or Paypal in the middle.\n  * The Bitcoin network issues all users a private key (essentially a really strong password) from which it cryptographically generates a linked public key. You can freely give people your public key – in fact, that’s the only piece of information anyone needs to send you Bitcoin. But to access those funds, the private key is required. \n  * Your public key is generated from your private key via a method called “hashing” – which is taking a string of data and processing it through an algorithm. It’s virtually impossible to reverse this process, so nobody can guess your private key from your public key.\n  * Because your public and private keys are linked, the network knows that your bitcoin belong to you – and will remain yours as long as you have your private key. \n  * Another impact of not having an intermediary is that Bitcoin transactions are irreversible (after all, there is no credit-card company to call if you make a mistake). But this is a feature, not a bug: permanent transactions are a key part of the solution to the double spend problem.\n  * The other half of the solution is the Bitcoin blockchain, which is a giant, decentralized ledger – imagine a bank’s balance books – that documents every transaction and is constantly verified and updated by all the computers in the network.\n\n\nInformation provided on this Site is for general educational purposes only and is not intended to constitute investment or other advice on financial products.

      "markdown": "Crypto wallets are designed to store your private key, keeping your crypto accessible at all times. They also allow you to send, receive, and spend cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum.\nUnlike a normal wallet, which can hold actual cash, crypto wallets technically don’t store your crypto. Your holdings live on the blockchain, but can only be accessed using a private key. Your keys prove your ownership of your digital money and allow you to make transactions. If you lose your private keys, you lose access to your money. That’s why it’s important to keep your hardware wallet safe.\n  * Keys are written on a physical medium like paper and stored in a safe place. This of course makes using your crypto harder, because as digital money it can only be used on the internet. \n  * Keys are stored in a thumb-drive device that is kept in a safe place and only connected to a computer when you want to use your crypto. The idea is to try to balance security and convenience.\n\n\nEach type has its tradeoffs. Paper and hardware wallets are harder for malicious users to access because they are stored offline, but they are limited in function and risk being lost or destroyed. Online wallets offered by a major exchange like Coinbase are one way to get started in crypto and offer security features such as entry via a passcode. However, it is essential to be aware of the risks associated with using online wallets. Because your private information is stored online, your protection against hackers is only as strong as your wallet provider's security measures. Therefore, it's crucial to look for features like two-factor authentication. Additionally, being online, these wallets are more susceptible to phishing attacks and other forms of cybercrime. To mitigate these risks, it's advisable to enable all available security features, stay vigilant against suspicious activity, and consider storing larger amounts of cryptocurrency in offline hardware wallets.\n\n\n  * The main Coinbase app (or Coinbase.com) allows you to buy and sell crypto or exchange it for fiat currency and transfer it to a bank account. If you just want to invest in or another digital currency it’s all you need. The Coinbase app will manage the rights to your private keys.\n  * Coinbase Wallet is a separate app that allows you to store your private keys and to send, receive, and spend digital money; browse and use DeFi applications, and more.

      "markdown": "A crypto wallet is a place where you can securely keep your crypto. There are many different types of crypto wallets, but the most popular ones are hosted wallets, non-custodial wallets, and hardware wallets. \nThe most popular and easy-to-set-up crypto wallet is a hosted wallet. When you buy crypto using an app like Coinbase, your crypto is automatically held in a hosted wallet. It’s called because a third party keeps your crypto for you, similar to how a bank keeps your money in a checking or savings account. You may have heard of people “losing their keys” or “losing their USB wallet” but with a hosted wallet you don’t have to worry about any of that.\nThe main benefit of keeping your crypto in a hosted wallet is if you forget your password, you won’t lose your crypto. A drawback to a hosted wallet is you can’t access everything crypto has to offer. However, that may change as hosted wallets start to support more features.\n  1. Most crypto platforms and exchanges allow you to buy crypto using a bank account or credit card. If you already own crypto, you can also transfer it to your new hosted wallet for safe keeping.\n\n\nA self-custody wallet, like , puts you in complete control of your crypto. Non-custodial wallets don’t rely on a third party — or a “custodian” — to keep your crypto safe. While they provide the software necessary to store your crypto, the responsibility of remembering and safeguarding your password falls entirely on you. If you lose or forget your password — often referred to as a “private key” or “seed phrase” — there’s no way to access your crypto. And if someone else discovers your private key, they’ll get full access to your assets. \nWhy have a non-custodial wallet? In addition to being in full control of the security of your crypto, you can also access more advanced crypto activities like yield farming, staking, lending, borrowing, and more. But if all you want to do is buy, sell, send, and receive crypto, a hosted wallet is the easiest solution.\n  1. It’s presented as a random 12-word phrase. Keep it in a secure location. If you lose or forget this 12-word phrase you won’t be able to access your crypto.\n  2. . It’s not always possible to buy crypto using traditional currencies (like US dollars or Euros) with a non-custodial wallet, so you’ll need to transfer crypto into your non-custodial wallet from elsewhere. \n\n\nIf you’re a Coinbase customer, you have your choice of a hosted wallet or a self-custody wallet. The Coinbase app, where you buy and sell crypto, is a hosted wallet. You can also download the standalone to take advantage of the benefits of a non-custodial wallet. Some of our customers have both, making it easy to buy crypto with traditional currency as well as participate in advanced crypto activities. Setting up either wallet is free.\nA hardware wallet is a physical device, about the size of a thumb drive, that stores the private keys to your crypto offline. Most people don’t use hardware wallets because of their increased complexity and cost, but they do have some benefits — for example, they can keep your crypto secure even if your computer is hacked. However, this advanced security makes them inconvenient to use compared to a software wallet and they can cost upwards of $100 to buy. \n  1. Each brand has their own software that’s needed to set up your wallet. Download the software from the official company website and follow the instructions to create your wallet.\n  2. Similar to a non-custodial wallet, a hardware wallet typically doesn’t allow you to buy crypto using traditional currencies (like US dollars or Euros), so you’ll need to transfer crypto to your wallet.\n\n\nJust as there are many ways to store cash (in a bank account, in a safe, under the bed), there are many ways to store crypto. You can keep things simple with a hosted wallet, have full control of your crypto with a non-custodial wallet, take extra precautions with a hardware wallet, or even have multiple types of wallets — with crypto the choice is yours.\nInformation provided on this Site is for general educational purposes only and is not intended to constitute investment or other advice on financial products.

      "markdown": "When you first buy cryptocurrency, you are issued two keys: a public key, which works like an email address (meaning you can safely share it with others, allowing you to send or receive funds), and a private key, which is typically a string of letters and numbers (and which is not to be shared with anyone). You can think of the private key as a password that unlocks the virtual vault that holds your money. As long as you — and only you — have access to your private key, your funds are safe and can be managed anywhere in the world with an internet connection. \n  * Cryptocurrencies like and are decentralized — meaning there is no bank or any other institution in the middle holding your digital money. Instead, your crypto is distributed across a network of computers via a technology called a blockchain. One feature of crypto blockchains is that they are open: all public key and transaction information is available for anyone to see.\n  * Via some complicated math, your public key is actually generated by your private key, which makes them a matched pair. When you make a transaction using your public key, you verify that it’s really you by using your private key. \n\n\n  * The best and simplest option for most people is to use a virtual wallet, like the one offered by Coinbase, to manage your private keys. These are known as “hot” wallets, because your private keys are stored on the internet. This makes buying, selling, or using your digital money as convenient and accessible as using a credit card online. Choose a wallet provided by a company with a long track record for security and features like two-factor authentication.\n  * Some investors choose to keep their private keys on a computer that isn’t connected to the internet, written on pieces of paper, or even just memorized. This is referred to as “cold storage,” and while it does protect your private key against digital theft, it makes using your cryptocurrency much less convenient while creating other risks. \n\n\nInformation provided on this Site is for general educational purposes only and is not intended to constitute investment or other advice on financial products.

      "markdown": "As crypto trading becomes increasingly mainstream, our Security team here at Coinbase has seen cybercriminals getting even more creative and persistent in their attempts to steal assets. While that can sound a little scary at first, the good news is that you can dramatically improve your digital security with just a few easy steps. Not only will this help protect your funds on Coinbase, it can be applied to the rest of your digital life as well!\nWhen someone is able to log into one of your accounts to perform fraudulent activity, this is called an “account takeover”, or “ATO” for short. But how do these fraudsters get into your account in the first place? One common method is called a “SIM-swap.” In a SIM-swap attack, fraudsters will actually contact your wireless carrier pretending to be you, and persuade the customer service agent to redirect your cell service to a different device, by changing the SIM card number associated with your account (hence the name of the attack.) Once they succeed, they are able to receive all calls and SMS messages sent to your phone number — including any two-factor authentication codes sent to you via SMS. From there, fraudsters will frequently pair those SMS 2FA codes with stolen passwords to try and log into your email account, social media profiles, cloud storage accounts like Dropbox, or financial accounts like Coinbase.\nAt Coinbase, we do a lot of work behind the scenes to detect and try to stop SIM-swap ATOs targeting our customers’ accounts. We also believe that using SMS-based two-factor authentication (2FA) is better than using no 2FA at all. That said, we encourage everyone to follow the two simple steps below and apply them to the accounts they care about — not just their Coinbase accounts.\n, extremely complex and unique for your accounts. That’s hard to do by yourself, but password managers like or can be used to create and remember your passwords.\n  * If SMS-based 2FA is the only thing available, — so someone can’t access your account if they have stolen your password.\n\n\n  * Hackers posing as tech support — even bad actors posing as Coinbase customer support specifically — may pressure you for account credentials. Coinbase will never ask you for passwords, 2FA codes, PIN numbers or for remote access to your computer.\n  * Coinbase will never ask you to create test accounts on other platforms or provide your ID or banking information over email or social media. We do not offer Facebook support chat and we will never call you by phone.\n  * If someone reaches out to you and you’re not sure if it’s a scam, you can reach out to security@coinbase.com to confirm whether it’s legitimate. And remember, Microsoft, Google, and Apple will never call you about your computer.\n\n\n  * Scammers create fake sites that look like real exchanges but are designed to steal account information. Double check the web address before you login into your account or input any of your credentials.\n  * If we emailed you and include a , copy the and paste it into a text editor before entering it into your browser to make sure you know where the is really taking you.\n\n\nWhile Coinbase has gone to great lengths to secure our environment, it’s important that everyone understands their role in maintaining the security chain.

      "markdown": "DeFi (or “decentralized finance”) is an umbrella term for financial services on public blockchains, primarily . With DeFi, you can do most of the things that banks support — earn interest, borrow, lend, buy insurance, trade derivatives, trade assets, and more — but it’s faster and doesn’t require paperwork or a third party. As with crypto generally, DeFi is global, peer-to-peer (meaning directly between two people, not routed through a centralized system), pseudonymous, and open to all. \nDeFi takes the basic premise of — digital money — and expands on it, creating an entire digital alternative to Wall Street, but without all the associated costs (think office towers, trading floors, banker salaries). This has the potential to create more open, free, and fair financial markets that are accessible to anyone with an internet connection.\n\n\nUsers typically engage with DeFi via software called dapps (“decentralized apps”), most of which currently run on the blockchain.

      "title": "What is a non-fungible token (NFT)?  | Coinbase",
      "markdown": "NFTs (or “non-fungible tokens”) are a special kind of cryptoasset in which each token is unique — as opposed to “fungible” assets like Bitcoin and dollar bills, which are all worth exactly the same amount. Because every NFT is unique, they can be used to authenticate ownership of digital assets like artworks, recordings, and virtual real estate or pets. \nIn February 2021, a 10-second video by an artist named Beeple . Around the same time, Christie’s announced that it would be selling a collage of 5,000 “all-digital” works by , whose real name is Mike Winkelmann. It was put on a virtual auction block with a starting price of $100 — and on March 11 it . \nBeyond the high prices, there was one other fact that observers found fascinating. In exchange for their money, collectors who buy Beeples don’t receive any physical manifestation of the artwork. Not even a framed print. What they get is an increasingly popular kind of cryptoasset called an NFT — short for non-fungible token. \nEach Beeple piece is paired with a unique NFT — a attesting that each owner’s version is the one. “We are in a very unknown territory,” Christie’s contemporary art specialist Noah Davis . “In the first 10 minutes of bidding we had more than a hundred bids from 21 bidders and we were at a million dollars.”\n\n\nAs and other crypto has boomed in popularity over the last year, NFTs have also soared — . Each NFT is stored on an open (often ’s) and anyone interested can track them as they’re created, sold, and resold. Because they use smart contract technology, NFTs can be set up so that the original artist continues to earn a percentage of all subsequent sales. \nAlong the way, NFTs have raised fascinating philosophical questions about the nature of ownership. Wondering why digital artifacts that can be endlessly copied and pasted have any value at all? Proponents would point out that most kinds of collecting isn’t based on inherent value. Old comic books were produced for pennies’ worth of ink and paper. Rare sneakers are often made out of the same materials as worthless ones. Some paintings hang in the Louvre, others end up in thrift shops. \nAs the collector who sold the $6.6 million Beeple piece noted, you can take a nice picture of the Mona Lisa, but it’s not the Mona Lisa. “It doesn’t have any value because it doesn’t have the provenance or the history of the work,” . “The reality here is that this is very, very valuable because of who is behind it.”\nEvery is worth as much as every other . NFTs, on the other hand, are all unique. “Fungibility” refers to goods or assets that are all the same and can be swapped interchangeably. A dollar bill is another perfect example — each is worth exactly one dollar. \nConcert tickets, by contrast, are non-fungible. Even if every Radiohead ticket is the same price, they aren’t directly exchangeable. Each represents a specific seat a specific date — no other ticket will have those exact characteristics.\nDigital-artwork NFTs are mostly sold on specialized marketplaces like , and . If you’re more interested in games and sports collectibles, developers like Dapper Labs have created experiences including NBA Top Shot (virtual trading cards) and Cryptokitties (a Pokemon-ish digital-cat collecting app that actually was the first NFT hit in late-2017). Online games including are starting to use NFTs to sell in-game assets like weapons or cosmetic upgrades. Real estate in new virtual worlds is sold via markets including and .\nIf you’re interested in DeFi, you might have heard of the ERC-20 standard, which allows anyone to create a token compatible with the blockchain. Those are “fungible” tokens. Most -fungible tokens are built using the ERC-721 and ERC-1155 standards, which allow creators to issue unique cryptoassets via smart contract. Because each NFT is stored on a blockchain, there is an immutable record starting with the token’s creation and including every sale. (Some NFT-focused developers have also built their own alternative blockchains, including Dapper Lab’s .)\nGood question! Some people display their digital artworks on large monitors. Some buy virtual real estate (via NFT, of course) in which they’re able to build virtual galleries or museums. You can also roam virtual worlds like Decentraland and check out other people’s collections. For some fans, the appeal is in the buying and selling — much like any other asset class. (The collector who sold the $6.9 million Beeple paid less than $70,000 for it in October 2020). \nMore and more mainstream artists have also gotten involved in the space — especially from the world of music. In early March, their next album would arrive in the form of multiple NFTs. Depending on which a fan buys, various perks will be unlocked — like alternate cover art, limited-edition vinyl, and even a “golden ticket” to a VIP concert experience. \nInformation provided on this Site is for general educational purposes only and is not intended to constitute investment or other advice on financial products.

      "markdown": "A decentralized exchange (or DEX) is a peer-to-peer marketplace where transactions occur directly between crypto traders. DEXs fulfill one of crypto’s core possibilities: fostering financial transactions that aren’t officiated by banks, brokers, or any other intermediary. Many popular DEXs, like Uniswap and Sushiwap, run on the Ethereum blockchain.\nA decentralized exchange (better known as a DEX) is a peer-to-peer marketplace where transactions occur directly between crypto traders. DEXs fulfill one of crypto’s core possibilities: fostering financial transactions that aren’t officiated by banks, brokers, payment processors, or any other kind of intermediary. The most popular DEXs — like and Sushiswap — utilize the blockchain and are part of the growing suite of tools, which make a huge range of financial services available directly from a compatible . DEXs are booming — in the first quarter of 2021, $217 billion in transactions flowed through decentralized exchanges. As of April 2021, there were more than two million DeFi traders, a ten-fold increase from May 2020.\nUnlike centralized exchanges like Coinbase, DEXs don’t allow for exchanges between fiat and crypto — instead, they exclusively trade cryptocurrency tokens for other cryptocurrency tokens. Via a centralized exchange (or CEX), you can trade fiat for crypto (and vice versa) or crypto-crypto pairs — say some of your for . You can also often make more advanced moves, like margin trades or setting limit orders. But all of these transactions are handled by the exchange itself via an “order book” that establishes the price for a particular cryptocurrency based on current buy and sell orders — the same method used by stock exchanges like Nasdaq. \nDecentralized exchanges, on the other hand, are simply a set of smart contracts. They establish the prices of various cryptocurrencies against each algorithmically and use “liquidity pools” — in which investors lock funds in exchange for interest-like rewards — to facilitate trades. \nDEXs are usually built on open-source code, meaning that anyone interested can see exactly how they work. That also means that developers can adapt existing code to create new competing projects — which is how ’s code has been adapted by an entire host of DEXs with “swap” in their names like Sushiswap and Pancakeswap. \nIf you’re interested in finding a hot token in its infancy, DeFi is the place to be. DEXs offer a virtually limitless range of tokens, from the well-known to the weird and totally random. That’s because anyone can mint an -based token and create a liquidity pool for it, so you’ll find a greater array of projects, both vetted and unvetted. (Buyer definitely beware!)\nBecause all of the funds in a DEX trade are stored on the traders’ own wallets, they are theoretically less susceptible to a hack. (Relatedly, DEXs also reduce what is known as “counterparty risk,” which is the likelihood that one of the involved parties — including potentially the central authority in a non-DeFi transaction — will default.) \nThe peer-to-peer lending, speedy transactions, and anonymity made possible by DEXs have made them increasingly popular in developing economies — where solid banking infrastructure might not be available. Anyone with a smartphone and an internet connection can trade via a DEX. \nNavigating decentralized exchanges requires some specialized knowledge and the interfaces aren’t always easy — be prepared to do a lot of research and don’t expect the DEX itself to offer much handholding. You’ll generally have to look offsite for a walk-through or explainer. Caution is required because it’s possible to make an unfixable error, like sending coins to the wrong wallet. Another common issue is known as “impermanent loss,” which can result from pairing a more volatile cryptocurrency with a less volatile one in a liquidity pool. (The main takeaway here? Do your own research.)\nAny DeFi protocol is only as secure as the smart contracts that power it — and code can have exploitable bugs (despite lengthy testing) that can result in the loss of your tokens. And while a smart contract might work as intended under normal circumstances, not all rare events, human factors, and hacks can be anticipated by developers. \nWith the unvetted, vast array of tokens available on most DEXs, there are also a greater number of scams and schemes to be wary of. A token that’s on a hot streak could suddenly be “rug pulled,” when its creator mints a bunch of new tokens, overwhelming the liquidity pool and tanking the value of the coin. Before you buy a new-to-you cryptocurrency or experiment with a new it’s important to learn as much as you can — read white papers, visit developer Twitter feeds or Discord channels, and look for audits of any particular project you’re interested in (some bigger auditors include Certik, Consensys, Chain Security, and Trail of Bits).\n  * You can connect to a DEX like using a crypto wallet such as in either your web browser or on your smartphone. If you are just getting started we recommend using the , available directly within your Coinbase app\n  * You’ll also need a supply of to start trading on most DEXs, which you can get from an exchange like Coinbase. The reason you need some ETH is for paying fees (known as gas) that are required for any transaction that happens on the Ethereum blockchain. These are separate from the fees the DEX itself charges. \n\n\nFees vary. charges a 0.3% fee that is split between liquidity providers, and a protocol fee could be added in the future. But it’s important to note that the fees the DEX charges can be dwarfed by gas fees to use the Ethereum network. The ongoing (as well as a number of “layer 2” solutions like Optimism and Polygon) are designed in part to lower fees and speed up transactions. \nInformation provided on this Site is for general educational purposes only and is not intended to constitute investment or other advice on financial products.

      "markdown": "Mining is the process that and several other cryptocurrencies use to generate new coins and verify new transactions. It involves vast, decentralized networks of computers around the world that verify and secure blockchains – the virtual ledgers that document cryptocurrency transactions. In return for contributing their processing power, computers on the network are rewarded with new coins. It’s a virtuous circle: the miners maintain and secure the blockchain, the blockchain awards the coins, the coins provide an incentive for the miners to maintain the blockchain.\nThere are three primary ways of obtaining bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. You can buy them on an exchange like Coinbase, receive them as payment for goods or services, or virtually “mine” them. It’s the third category that we’re explaining here, using as our example. \nYou might have considered trying bitcoin mining yourself. In Bitcoin's early years, anyone with a decent home computer could participate. But as the blockchain has grown, the computational power required to maintain it has increased. (By a : the computing power required to mine one Bitcoin in 2024 is vastly higher - around 6 times more - than when the first Bitcoin blocks were mined in 2009, due to the exponential growth in mining difficulty over the past 15 years as more miners have joined the network.) \nAs a result, amateur bitcoin mining hasn't typically been profitable for hobbyists in years. Virtually all mining is now done by specialized companies or groups of people who band their resources together. But it’s still good to know how it works.\n  * Specialized computers perform the calculations required to verify and record every new bitcoin transaction and ensure that the blockchain is secure. Verifying the blockchain requires a vast amount of computing power, which is voluntarily contributed by miners. \n  * Bitcoin mining is a lot like running a big data center. Companies purchase the mining hardware and pay for the electricity required to keep it running (and cool). For this to be profitable, the value of the earned coins has to be higher than the cost to mine those coins.\n  * What motivates miners? The network holds a lottery. Every computer on the network races to be the first to guess a 64-digit hexadecimal number known as a “hash.” The faster a computer can spit out guesses, the more likely the miner is to earn the reward. \n  * The winner updates the blockchain ledger with all the newly verified transactions – thereby adding a newly verified “block” containing all those transactions to the chain – and is granted a predetermined amount of newly minted bitcoin. (On average, this happens every ten minutes.) As of April 2024, the reward is 3.125 bitcoin per block, and as the difficulty of mining increases with each , the reward will keep decreasing until no more bitcoins are left to be mined.\n  * There will only ever be 21 million bitcoin. The final block should theoretically be mined in 2140. From that point forward, miners will no longer rely on newly issued bitcoin as reward, but instead will rely on the fees they charge for making transactions.\n\n\nBeyond releasing new coins into circulation, mining is central to (and many other cryptocurrencies’) security. It verifies and secures the blockchain, which allows cryptocurrencies to function as a peer-to-peer decentralized network without any need for oversight from a third party. And it creates the incentive for miners to contribute their computing power to the network.\nInformation provided on this Site is for general educational purposes only and is not intended to constitute investment or other advice on financial products.

In return for helping the network run smoothly and securely, you receive more of the cryptocurrency you're staking. The rewards come from the network itself—your crypto isn’t being lent out. It’s a safe, simple and popular way to grow your crypto while holding.\nThe biggest benefit of staking is earning rewards. Rather than letting your crypto sit unused, staking allows you to grow your crypto over time while contributing to the blockchain’s security.\nHow much you earn and how often you receive payouts will depend on which cryptocurrency you stake. The most common networks users stake with are and . To see the latest rewards rates for eligible staking assets go or check your . \nMany blockchain networks use a decentralized group of validators and asset holders to verify and process crypto transactions, instead of relying on centralized intermediaries like banks. As a reward for temporarily delegating their assets to the blockchain networks, these asset owners and validators earn crypto through network rewards and fees directly from the networks.\nWhen you stake on Coinbase, Coinbase handles the validation process, pooling your staked coins with others and distributing network rewards to you. To learn more about how staking on Coinbase works, visit our . \nAlthough it’s unlikely, there is a possibility you could lose your staked assets due to a network or validator failure. However, no customer has lost crypto staking with Coinbase. As a publicly traded, audited company, Coinbase is to compliance with both regulators and the rules of the networks on which it stakes.\nYes, you can request to unstake anytime. Depending on the specific cryptocurrency, there may be a waiting period while your crypto is fully unstaked before you can withdraw your staked assets. You also may not be able to send your assets immediately while they are being unstaked.\nFor some assets, there is a waiting period before you can start earning rewards when you stake. Similarly, when you decide to unstake there may be a cooldown period during which you won't earn rewards. This could take from a few minutes to several weeks, depending on the asset. Coinbase displays the estimated withdrawal time when you stake your assets.\nIf you are new to Coinbase, you will need to your account, purchase or transfer in eligible staking assets, and then opt in to stake. If you are an existing customer, go to your to stake any eligible assets you already hold or buy eligible assets and opt in to staking. \nInformation provided on this Site is for general educational purposes only and is not intended to constitute investment or other advice on financial products.

      "title": "What is \"proof of work\" or \"proof of stake\"? | Coinbase",
      "markdown": "“Proof of work” and “proof of stake” are the two major consensus mechanisms cryptocurrencies use to verify new transactions, add them to the blockchain, and create new tokens. Proof of work, first pioneered by Bitcoin, uses mining to achieve those goals. Proof of stake — which is employed by Cardano, the ETH2 blockchain, and others — uses staking to achieve the same things. \nDecentralized cryptocurrency networks need to make sure that nobody spends the same money twice without a central authority like Visa or PayPal in the middle. To accomplish this, networks use something called a “consensus mechanism,” which is a system that allows all the computers in a crypto network to agree about which transactions are legitimate. \nThere are two major consensus mechanisms used by most cryptocurrencies today. is the older of the two, used by , 1.0, and many others. The newer consensus mechanism is called , and it powers 2.0, , Tezos and other (generally newer) cryptocurrencies. To understand proof of stake, it’s helpful to first understand proof of work, so we’ve paired them in this explainer. \nProof of work is the original crypto consensus mechanism, first used by . Proof of work and are closely related ideas. The reason it’s called “proof of work” is because the network requires a huge amount of processing power. Proof-of-work blockchains are secured and verified by virtual miners around the world racing to be the first to solve a math puzzle. The winner gets to update the blockchain with the latest verified transactions and is rewarded by the network with a predetermined amount of crypto. \nProof of work has some powerful advantages, especially for a relatively simple but hugely valuable cryptocurrency like (). It’s a proven, robust way of maintaining a secure decentralized blockchain. As the value of a cryptocurrency grows, more miners are incentivized to join the network, increasing its power and security. Because of the amount of processing power involved, it becomes impractical for any individual or group to meddle with a valuable cryptocurrency’s blockchain. \nOn the flip side, it’s an energy-intensive process that can have trouble scaling to accommodate the vast number of transactions compatible blockchains like can generate. And so alternatives have been developed, the most popular of which is called proof of stake.\n’s developers understood from the beginning that proof of work would present limitations in scalability that would eventually need to be overcome — and, indeed, as Ethereum-powered protocols have surged in popularity, the blockchain has struggled to keep up, causing fees to spike. \nWhile the Bitcoin blockchain mostly just has to process incoming and outgoing bitcoin transactions, much like a vast checkbook, Ethereum’s blockchain also has to process a vast array of DeFi transactions, smart contracts, minting and sales, and whatever innovations developers come up with in the future. \nTheir solution has been to build an entirely new blockchain — which began rolling out in December 2020 and should be finished in 2022. The upgraded version of Ethereum will employ a faster and less resource intensive consensus mechanism called proof of stake. Cryptocurrencies including , Tezos, and Atmos all use proof-of-stake consensus mechanisms — with the goal being to maximize speed and efficiency while lowering fees. \nIn a proof of stake system, staking serves a similar function to proof of work’s mining, in that it’s the process by which a network participant gets selected to add the latest batch of transactions to the blockchain and earn some crypto in exchange. \nThe exact details vary by project, but in general proof of stake blockchains employ a network of “validators” who contribute — or “stake” — their own crypto in exchange for a chance of getting to validate new transaction, update the blockchain, and earn a reward. \n  * The network selects a winner based on the amount of crypto each validator has in the pool and the length of time they’ve had it there — literally rewarding the most invested participants. \n  * Once the winner has validated the latest block of transactions, other validators can attest that the block is accurate. When a threshold number of attestations have been made, the network updates the blockchain. \n\n\nBecoming a validator is a major responsibility and requires a fairly high level of technical knowledge. The minimum amount of crypto that validators are required to stake is often relatively high (for ETH2, for example, it’s 32 ETH) and validators can lose some of their stake via a process called slashing if their node goes offline or if they validate a “bad” block of transactions. \nBut even if that sounds like too much responsibility, you can still participate in staking by joining a staking pool run by someone else — and earn rewards for crypto that would otherwise be sitting around. This process is often referred to as delegating, and tools offered by exchanges by Coinbase can make it simple and seamless. \nBoth consensus mechanisms have economic consequences that penalize network disruptions and thwart malicious actors. In proof of work, the penalty for miners submitting invalid information, or blocks, is the sunk cost of computing power, energy, and time. In proof of stake, the validators’ staked crypto funds serve as an economic incentive to act in the network’s best interests. In the case that a validator accepts a bad block, a portion of their staked funds will be “slashed” as a penalty. The amount that a validator can be slashed depends on the network.\nInformation provided on this Site is for general educational purposes only and is not intended to constitute investment or other advice on financial products.

      "markdown": "  * Although the term “stablecoin” is commonly used, there is no guarantee that the asset will maintain a stable value in relation to the value of the reference asset when traded on secondary markets or that the reserve of assets, if there is one, will be adequate to satisfy all redemptions.\n\n\nStablecoins are a type of cryptocurrency that seeks to maintain a stable value by pegging their market value to an external reference. This reference could be a fiat currency like the U.S. dollar, a commodity such as gold, or another financial instrument. The primary goal of stablecoins is to provide an alternative to the high volatility of popular cryptocurrencies like , which can make these digital assets less suitable for common transactions.\nStablecoins play a crucial role in the cryptocurrency ecosystem due to their stability. Cryptocurrencies like and offer numerous benefits, such as not requiring trust in an intermediary institution to send payments anywhere and to anyone. However, their prices are unpredictable and can fluctuate wildly, making them challenging for everyday use. Stablecoins aim to tackle these price fluctuations by tying the value of cryptocurrencies to more stable assets, usually fiat currencies. This stability aims to maintain their value over time and encourages their adoption in regular transactions.\nThere are primarily three types of stablecoins: fiat-collateralized, crypto-collateralized, and non-collateralized (algorithmic). Fiat-collateralized stablecoins are pegged to a specific asset, such as a fiat currency. The entity behind the stablecoin maintains a reserve of the asset or assets backing the stablecoin, supporting the value of the digital currency. On the other hand, non-collateralized (algorithmic) stablecoins use software algorithms to automatically adjust the supply of the stablecoin based on demand, aiming to maintain a stable price.\nStablecoins continue to come under scrutiny by regulators due to their rapid growth and potential to affect the broader financial system. As the market for stablecoins expands, regulatory bodies worldwide are taking a closer look at these digital assets to ensure they comply with financial laws and regulations. This scrutiny aims to protect investors and maintain the stability of the financial system.\nStablecoins play a vital role in the cryptocurrency ecosystem. They aim to provide the speed and security features of a blockchain while eliminating the volatility that most cryptocurrencies endure. Initially used primarily to buy cryptocurrencies on trading platforms that did not offer fiat currency trading pairs, stablecoins have seen their adoption grow. They are now used in several blockchain-based financial services, such as lending platforms, and can even be used to pay for goods and services.\nInformation provided on this Site is for general educational purposes only and is not intended to constitute investment or other advice on financial products.

      "markdown": "Technically, “token” is just another word for “cryptocurrency” or “cryptoasset.” But increasingly it has taken on a couple of more specific meanings depending on context. The first is to describe all cryptocurrencies Bitcoin and Ethereum (even though they are technically also tokens). The second is to describe certain digital assets that run another cryptocurrencies’ blockchain, as many decentralized finance (or DeFi) tokens do. Tokens have a huge range of potential functions, from helping make decentralized exchanges possible to selling rare items in video games. But they can all be traded or held like any other cryptocurrency.\n“Token” is a word that you hear a lot in cryptocurrency. In fact, you might hear described as a “crypto token” or something similar, because — technically — all cryptoassets can also be described as tokens. But the word has increasingly taken on two specific meanings that are common enough that there’s a good chance you’ll encounter them. \n  * A “token” often refers to and are by far the biggest two cryptocurrencies, it’s useful to have a word to describe the universe of other coins. (Another word you might hear with virtually the same meaning is “altcoin.”)\n  * The other increasingly common meaning for “token” has an even more specific connotation, which is to describe. You’ll encounter this usage if you become interested in decentralized finance (or DeFi). While a cryptocurrency like Bitcoin has its own dedicated blockchain, DeFi tokens like and run , or leverage, an existing blockchain, most commonly ’s. \n  * Tokens in this second category help decentralized applications to do everything from automate interest rates to sell virtual real estate. But they can also be held or traded like any other cryptocurrency.\n\n\nGiven that you’ll come across the word a lot while researching cryptocurrencies, it’s useful to understand some common connotations. But besides the big-picture definitions in the section above, there are also some categories of cryptoassets that actually have “token” in their name. Here are a few examples of those:\n  * A new world of cryptocurrency-based protocols that aim to reproduce traditional financial-system functions (lending and saving, insurance, trading) has emerged in recent years. These protocols issue tokens that perform a wide variety of functions but can also be traded or held like any other cryptocurrency.\n  * These are specialized DeFi tokens that give holders a say in the future of a protocol or app, which (being decentralized) don’t have boards of directors or any other central authority. The popular savings protocol Compound, for example, issues all users a token called COMP. This token gives holders a vote in how Compound is upgraded. The more COMP tokens you have, the more votes you get.\n  * NFTs represent ownership rights to a unique digital or real-world asset. They can be used to make it more difficult for digital creations to be copied and shared (an issue anyone who has ever visited a Torrent site full of the latest movies and video games understands). They’ve also been used to issue a limited number of digital artworks or sell unique virtual assets like rare items in a video game. \n  * Security tokens are a new class of assets that aim to be the crypto equivalent of traditional securities like stocks and bonds. Their main use case is to sell shares in a company (very much like the shares or fractional shares sold via conventional markets) or other enterprises (for instance, real estate) without the need for a broker. Major companies and startups have been reported to be investigating security tokens as a potential alternative to other methods of fundraising.\n\n\nInformation provided on this Site is for general educational purposes only and is not intended to constitute investment or other advice on financial products.

      "markdown": "Whether you're just starting your crypto journey or you've been trading for years, there’s a good chance you’ve tried to dig into the world beyond and only to find yourself confused by all the different cryptocurrencies out there.\nAfter all, in the decade since began to catch on, thousands of alternatives have emerged — with an ever-growing selection . In the last few years, tokens that help power decentralized finance (or DeFi) protocols have become increasingly popular — and so a number of the cryptocurrencies on this list come from that world.\nIf you’re ready to figure out the difference between XTZ and , you've come to the right place. Here (presented in alphabetical order) is key information about some of the biggest and most important cryptocurrencies that Bitcoin or . Each of these \"altcoins\" (short for “alternative coins”) is tradable via Coinbase and other major exchanges, and they all have unique features, goals, and use cases.\nis a decentralized lending protocol (part of the broader group of protocols known as ) that allows users to deposit crypto assets to earn APY rewards, and to borrow other crypto assets against that collateral. It makes it possible for users to borrow, lend, and earn interest on their crypto — making use of smart contracts instead of intermediaries like banks. \nThe protocol facilitates the creation of lending pools. If you want to lend some of your crypto, you can deposit it into a pool. Anyone who wants to borrow deposited assets can draw from Aave pools as long as they provide sufficient collateral. (Fun fact: “Aave” means ghost in Finnish.) \n  * aTokens are received by lenders depositing to the lending pools, and they entitle them to earn interest payments. (If you deposit, say, , you’ll receive aETH in return. When you pull your ETH out of Aave, your aETH will automatically be converted back to ETH.)\n  * To help users take advantage of arbitrage opportunities (where a crypto might be valued higher on one than it is on another) and maximize profits in the DeFi ecosystems, Aave also provides flash loans. These loans require no collateral and are settled instantly. The condition is that the borrowed amount needs to be paid back within the same transaction, along with a 0.09% fee, or the whole process will be cancelled and no funds are borrowed.\n\n\nStandard loans on Aave require collateral (such as ) provided by the borrower. Because crypto can be volatile, it’s important to choose the collateral carefully if you use Aave to borrow crypto. If your collateral’s value drops below a certain threshold it can be liquidated (as in: you won’t get your money back) and you might be subject to added fees. For this reason, stablecoins are a popular collateral option. Be sure to carefully read Aave’s terms and conditions. \nDevelopers can use to create decentralized applications — for loans, decentralized trading, and many other uses — that can take advantage of fast, low-cost transaction processing while scaling to a large number of users.\nnodes reach consensus about what should appear in the blockchain through a process called PPoS (or “Pure Proof of Stake”) — which uses a staking system (instead of a Proof of Work mining system like Bitcoin’s) to verify new transactions and produce new crypto tokens. \nAlgorand network participants (or nodes) are able to stake some of their ALGO in exchange for the chance to be randomly selected to propose a new block of verified transaction. The winner is awarded new ALGO.\nPPoS systems like Algorand’s are more efficient than Proof of Work blockchains like Bitcoin in terms of electricity consumption, because they don’t rely on thousands of miners spending energy to solve cryptographic puzzles for the chance to win a block reward and earn transaction fees.\nBitcoin, in its original conception, was designed to be a form of digital cash people could use to make transactions online. Over time it has evolved into a “store of wealth” more like digital gold. was created to continue the original peer-to-peer cash idea — via a high-volume, low-fee network that would be accessible to anyone with an internet connection. \nThe blockchain is based on the original Bitcoin blockchain, but it has some distinct differences. A major one is an increased maximum block size of 32MB, compared to just 1MB on Bitcoin. Increased block size allows to process transactions faster than Bitcoin, with lower fees and an increased per-second transaction capacity. \nBitcoin Cash is available via virtually all exchanges and is supported by PayPal. But remember that even though it was designed to be faster and cheaper than Bitcoin, that doesn’t mean that Bitcoin users have abandoned the original for a newer version.\nis designed to be a next-gen evolution of the idea. It’s intended to be a flexible, sustainable, and scalable platform for running , which will allow the development of a wide range of apps, new crypto , games, and more. \n  * Cardano’s goal is to be the most environmentally sustainable blockchain platform. It uses a unique proof-of-stake consensus mechanism called Ouroboros, as opposed to the energy-intensive proof-of-work system currently used by Bitcoin and Ethereum. (Ethereum is also moving to a proof-of-stake system via the ETH2 upgrade). \n  * The Cardano blockchain is also divided into two separate layers: the Cardano Settlement Layer (CSL) and the Cardano Computing Layer (CCL). The CSL contains the ledger of accounts and balances (and is where the transactions are validated by the Ouroboros consensus mechanism). The CCL layer is where all the computations for apps running on the blockchain are executed — via the operations of smart contracts.\n\n\nOracles are an important part of the landscape: in the absence of a centralized authority, they’re the main mechanism by which DeFi apps receive accurate external data (especially prices). Until was developed, there was no reliable solution that allowed smart contracts and DeFi apps to access external market prices.\nChainlink was designed to incentivize a global network of computers (or “nodes”) to provide accurate data to Chainlink’s oracles. There are many oracles operating today, including ones that provide price data across a wide range of assets, weather data, and location data. \nIn order to become a node and start providing data to Chainlink oracles, holders must stake LINK tokens into a smart contract to act as an incentive against misbehaving or submitting false data to the network.\nCompound is a decentralized lending protocol that allows users to deposit crypto assets to earn APY rewards, and to borrow other crypto assets against that collateral. It’s part of the growing suite of apps that primarily run on the Ethereum blockchain.\n  * When you supply an asset to Compound, you immediately begin receiving interest on that deposit. A borrowing limit is then determined, based on the value of the collateral you’ve supplied.\n  * When you deposit funds into Compound, you receive a special cToken in return. For example, if you deposit USD Coin into Compound, you’ll find cUSDC in your — and when you withdraw your , the cUSDC will disappear from your wallet. (cUSDC can also be held, transferred, and traded just like any other token.) \n  * The yield on the crypto you deposit into Compound currently comes in two forms: interest in the form of cTokens and rewards in native COMP . The interest rate for each Compound market is dynamic and based purely on supply and demand.\n\n\nIn traditional finance, the model of supplying one asset to borrow another is called “over-collateralized lending.” It can help investors to gain exposure to more markets and enable advanced trading strategies like leveraging borrowed crypto to invest in other assets (but keep in mind that there are risks associated with collateralized lending, including potentially losing your collateral). \naims to be the “internet of blockchains” by allowing developers to build their own blockchains, each of which are interconnected via the network. is the native cryptocurrency, used for and securing the “Global Hub,” which connects all of these blockchains.\nThe main idea of Cosmos is to allow for faster and cheaper decentralized applications — anything from an NFT marketplaces to — by allowing them to run on their own dedicated blockchains. \n  * The Cosmos consensus engine, IBC protocol, and software developer kit are designed to enable ease of use and interoperability between chains, while maintaining the security and transaction cost and speed developers would expect from other leading blockchain platforms. \n\n\nWhen Dash — the name combines Digital and Cash — was first launched, its developers’ focus was on total user privacy and anonymity. (In fact, for a while it was called Darkcoin.) But in recent years, the mission has evolved towards positioning the currency as a useful method of payment for daily transactions, although it does still offer strong encryption and privacy features. \n  * Each Masternode is incentivized to be honest because they must have at least 1,000 of their own DASH staked. This staked DASH can be “slashed” if the Masternode validates an improper transaction. \n\n\nFor most of its existence, (pronounced “dohj coin”) was considered to be an amusing “memecoin” beloved by its community — but with relatively little value. That changed in 2021, when became one of the larger cryptocurrencies by — with a total value that has topped $50 billion, even though each individual coin is worth pennies. \nAbundance is a key part of the idea — was created as a fun, low-stakes Bitcoin alternative. As soon as it was launched in late 2013, it began attracting an enthusiastic online community that famously once used DOGE to help to the 2014 Winter Olympics in Sochi.\nUnlike Bitcoin, which is designed to be scarce and resistant to inflation, Dogecoin was created to be abundant. There are about 130 billion DOGE circulating, and miners produce another 10,000 every minute. \nEnjin is an ecosystem that aids in the creation and management of virtual goods, better known as NFTs. It provides tools for building and selling unique digital items. The Enjin platform aims to give users access to the true ownership of their digital collectibles and allow easy trading.\nThe ENJ is the platform’s native currency. When a new NFT is minted on the network, a chosen amount of ENJ is minted into the token. The locked funds give the newly built goods real world value, as each item can be at any point melted back into the underlying ENJ backing.\nThe Enjin platform also provides software developer kits (SDKs) that equip developers with tools to build their own NFTs on the Ethereum blockchain and enable their integration into the gaming ecosystems or apps of their choice. \nNFTs created with Enjin use a standard called ERC-1155, which was developed by Enjin’s team and is distinct from the more common ERC-721 standard pioneered by the NFT art project Cryptopunks. \nEOSIO aims to be an alternative to Ethereum. It provides blockchain infrastructure for decentralized applications, acting as a “blockchain computer,” and allows developers to create, deploy, and host their own smart contracts and decentralized apps (or dapps).\n: EOSIO claims to be able to support thousands of dapps without experiencing any negative network effects like high fees or slow confirmation times, thanks to innovations like parallel processing. This may be appealing for commercial developers and financial institutions looking to adopt blockchain technologies for large-scale use cases.\nThe network’s native token, EOS, is used to power transactions and applications on the blockchain, and can be staked for a reward in a consensus model called Delegated Proof of Stake (DPoS.)\n: EOSIO was created to be easy for developers and end-users to adopt, with a specific focus on the pain points faced by developers of blockchain applications today – particularly those of speed, scalability, and flexibility in program design.\n() is a cryptocurrency that powers the network, which is a decentralized, peer-to-peer competitor to cloud storage products like Dropbox or Amazon Web Services. Data stored via Filecoin is distributed across the entire network — as opposed to traditional centralized-server storage. \nFilecoin aims to provide a faster, cheaper, and more reliable distributed infrastructure for storing and retrieving data. It functions as a marketplace where developers can rent storage space — similar to a traditional cloud storage. But instead of trusting one provider with your files, they’re split up and served by a globally distributed network of computers.\n  * In a storage deal, the client chooses a miner to store their data and locks up the funds necessary to pay for storage. Once the agreement is accepted, the file is transferred and stored by the miner. The miner provides continuous proof of storage to the chain in order to receive rewards from the funds locked up by a client. If they fail to provide a proof (or if proof is delayed) the miner gets penalized.\n  * In a retrieval deal, the client makes a payment to a retrieval miner to extract the data from the network. (Retrieval miners can also be storage miners, but they don’t have to be.) These deals are executed “off-chain” — using micropayment channels to reward miners for data retrieval.\n\n\nAnyone with a compatible computer can start mining FIL by becoming a storage provider, making their hard-drive space available for use by the network in return for rewards. Mining configurations can range from a single desktop computer to a large-scale server farm.\nThe Graph is a decentralized and open-source protocol for indexing and querying blockchain data. GRT is the Ethereum that fuels The Graph’s ecosystem. It’s used to pay participants on the network that contribute by submitting or verifying data.\nMuch in the way search engines index the web, The Graph aims to index blockchain data within networks like Ethereum and Filecoin. This data is grouped into open APIs called subgraphs that make it easy for developers to query the data via the GraphQL API. By making data accessible, The Graph provides applications like the data they need to operate effectively. \n\n\nIndexing requires a large contribution of GRT and technical knowledge — but anyone can delegate some GRT to an Indexer and receive a cut of their query and indexing rewards.\n’s basic idea is to create a new kind of decentralized internet and global computing system — with independent data centers all over the world joining together to create an alternative to the cloud services (from companies like Amazon Web Services and Google Cloud) that power most of the current internet. The token has several major uses: it acts as a governance token (allowing holders to “lock” some of their into the network in exchange for having a say in the future development of the ICP protocol), is rewarded by the network to participating data centers for good behavior, and is used to pay transaction fees on the network. \nYou can think of ICP as a way of converting crypto into processing power. The network will establish a fee based on the amount of computing power required by a developer’s project. As long as the fee is paid, the website will run directly on the public internet. \nIn a truly decentralized network, who can be held accountable for hosting abusive content? Corporations running the Internet today employ some degree of moderation, although the flip side is that they can also arbitrarily de-platform anyone at any time. Ideally, Internet Computer can use decentralized governance to create solutions to these tricky issues.\nAs a fork of Bitcoin, did not aim to change the fundamental logic or architecture – being nearly identical to Bitcoin in terms of use and design — but with a reduced transaction confirmation time and much lower cost (as much as 50 times lower, depending on market conditions).\n: ’s speed and relatively low fees make it appealing as a payment option and means of transferring value, but the network has significantly fewer miners than Bitcoin, which has negative effects in terms of overall network security.\nMakerDAO is a decentralized organization built on the Ethereum blockchain that runs a DeFi platform that allows users to lend and borrow crypto. Its native token is a stablecoin called . is an ERC-20 token, which means it runs on the Ethereum blockchain. It is designed to maintain a stable value of one US dollar. MKR is a governance token issued to users of MakerDAO DeFi services. It gives holders a say in the future of the organization.\nUsers create DAI by depositing some of their crypto into a smart contract on the platform. Once DAI is created, it functions as a token on the Ethereum blockchain that can be transferred between wallets to facilitate the transfer of value like any other cryptocurrency. DAI is useful as a medium for transfers because each token always aims to be worth one U.S. dollar — which means the value won’t swing wildly during the duration of the transaction. This type of stable cryptocurrency is known as a stablecoin.\nWith digital privacy and censorship growing as concerns for people around the world, VPN services (“Virtual Private Network”) have become a popular tool for privately and securely browsing the internet and interacting with online services.\nOrchid is a crypto-powered VPN service that aims to extend the functionality of traditional VPN services with the security and anonymity benefits of blockchain technologies. OXT is an Ethereum token that serves as a secure means of paying for the use of Orchid's VPN service. \n  * Bandwidth providers are Orchid Nodes that have staked OXT tokens in order to supply their surplus internet bandwidth to users. In exchange, they receive compensation in OXT tokens. The more OXT staked, the greater the chances for a reward. \n\n\nBut you don’t need to be a full bandwidth provider to benefit from staking OXT. Any holder of OXT can stake some of their tokens in a pool with a full bandwidth provider. \nOrchid aims to provide a distributed network of trusted, high quality bandwidth providers, allowing users to access the internet privately, and instead of relying on relying on one centralized VPN service. \nOMG was designed to be used by businesses and DeFi apps to create systems that use a blockchain to transfer value between various digital and fiat currencies, and to create financial tools and services that are fast, cheap and secure.\nBuilt on top of the Ethereum blockchain, OMG intends to integrate with other blockchain networks and traditional payment providers to allow businesses to transfer value from one blockchain to another, or to transfer funds between blockchains and traditional payment settlement companies like Visa and Swift.\nFormally known as OmiseGo, OMG is a layer-2 Ethereum scaling solution designed to be integrated into mainstream wallets. It works on top of the Ethereum blockchain to allow users to transfer Ethereum tokens faster and more cheaply than transferring them on the Ethereum blockchain directly.\nOMG holders can also stake some of their tokens, which helps the network stay secure. When you stake some OMG, you earn a percentage of the overall fees that the OMG Network generates from end users.\nOMG claims to be “currency agnostic.” Fees remain the same no matter which currencies are and blockchains are involved in a given transaction. This feature could be particularly useful for payment processors and financial institutions.\nis a protocol that connects blockchains — allowing value and data to be sent across previously incompatible networks (Bitcoin and Ethereum, for example). It’s also designed to be fast and scalable. The token is used for and governance; it can be bought or sold on Coinbase and other exchanges. \nThe Polkadot network includes a main blockchain called the “relay chain” and many user-created parallel chains (or “parachains”). It also has a connecting layer, or “bridge,” that allows value and data to be transferred between most blockchains — and can even be used to connect to non-blockchain databases. \nThe reason Polkadot can process so much information is because the many parachains do a lot of the heavy lifting for the main relay chain. As a result, the Polkadot network can process more than , compared to about 7 for Bitcoin and 30 for Ethereum. As the network grows and more parachains are added, Polkadot should get even faster, with speeds that could hit a million transactions per second.\nThe Polkadot (DOT) serves two main functions within the Polkadot network: it’s a governance token, which allows holders to have a say in the future of the protocol, and it’s used for staking, which is the way the Polkadot network verifies transactions and issues new DOT. DOT can be bought and sold on exchanges like Coinbase\nPolygon is a “layer two” or “sidechain” scaling solution that runs alongside the Ethereum blockchain — allowing for speedy transactions and low fees. MATIC is the network’s native cryptocurrency, which is used for fees, staking, and more. You can buy or sell MATIC via exchanges like Coinbase. The name MATIC comes from an earlier stage in Polygon’s development. After launching as Matic Network in October 2017, developers rebranded as Polygon early in 2021. \nPicture Polygon as being like an express train on a subway — it travels along the same route as the regular train, but it makes fewer stops and thus moves much faster. (In this analogy the main Ethereum blockchain is the local train.) \n  * do the heavy lifting — they verify new transactions and add them to the blockchain. In exchange, they may receive a cut of fees and newly created MATIC. Becoming a validator is a commitment that requires running a full-time node (or computer) and staking your own MATIC. If you make an error or act maliciously (or even if your internet connection is glitchy) you could lose some of your staked MATIC.\n  * stake their MATIC indirectly via a trusted validator. This is a much lower-commitment version of staking. But it still requires research — if the validator you pick acts maliciously or makes errors you could lose some or all of your staked MATIC.\n\n\nThe Polygon network allows you to do many of the same things the main Ethereum network allows, but with fees that are often a fraction of a cent. You can try like QuikSwap or SushiSwap, lending and savings protocols like Aave, NFT markets like OpenSea, or even “no-loss prize games” like Pooltogether. \nTo try the Polygon network, you need to send some crypto to a compatible crypto wallet like . You can then “bridge” some of your crypto — stablecoins are a popular choice for this — to the Polygon network. You’ll also need to bridge some MATIC to make transactions, but even a dollar’s worth is plenty because fees are so low. \nis one of a number of cryptocurrencies designed to compete with Ethereum. Like Ethereum, is both a cryptocurrency and a flexible platform for running crypto apps — everything from projects like Degenerate Apes to the Serum (or DEX). \nSolana’s native cryptocurrency is . It’s used to pay transaction fees and for . It also serves as a “governance token,” meaning that holders also are able to vote on future upgrades and governance proposals that are submitted by the Solana community. SOL is available to buy and sell via exchanges like Coinbase. \nOne way Solana achieves high transaction speeds is via a combination of the and a new mechanism called “proof of history.” Proof of history is designed to between computers on a decentralized network without all the computers having to communicate about it and come to an agreement. \nLike Ethereum, Solana is a computing platform that can interact with . Smart contracts power a , from NFT markets and DeFi to games and decentralized lotteries. \nOne reason a user might choose an app that runs on Solana over, say, Ethereum, is that speeds are high and congestion is low — resulting in very low fees. (But always remember that there can be risks associated with emerging crypto applications and technologies, from volatility to the potential for undiscovered smart-contract bugs to be exploited.)\nis an open-source blockchain network optimized for payments and digital asset issuance. Launched back in 2014 and supported by the non-profit Stellar Development Foundation, Stellar aims to connect the world’s financial system, enabling businesses and developers to take advantage of the network’s fast speeds, low transaction costs, and interoperability. \nAnyone can issue an asset – whether that be fiat, precious metals, any form of value – as a digital token on the Stellar network. Stellar then facilitates transactions with these tokens from anywhere across the globe, and much more quickly, affordably, and sustainably than existing alternatives in the traditional financial system. All this network activity is fueled by (or XLM).\nUnlike Proof-of-Work or Proof-of-Stake blockchains, Stellar uses the Stellar Consensus Protocol (SCP) to gain agreement on which transactions are added to its blockchain from a series of voting processes by trusted and known participants called validator nodes. When enough participants in trusted overlapping groups (called a quorum) agree that a transaction set is valid, it will be permanently added to the blockchain – a process that takes about 5 seconds.\nStellar can be used as a fast and cheaper alternative to financial services such as cross-border payments and remittances — allowing users to send and receive payments in their preferred currency. There are now payment corridors across multiple regions that use Stellar as a bridge asset to bring money transfer services to businesses and people in areas that traditionally lack access to financial services.\nSushiSwap is a built on the Ethereum network. Originally forked from , SushiSwap leverages smart contracts in order to provide liquidity pools that allow users to directly trade crypto assets — with no intermediary. Users can also become liquidity pool providers, supplying an equal value pair of two cryptocurrencies in order to receive rewards whenever anyone utilizes that pool. It is a protocol. \n  * You can use Sushiswap to trade one cryptocurrency for another directly — it can’t be used to trade fiat for crypto or vice versa. It uses the Automated Market Maker model pioneered by . \n  * Users can deposit their newly created LP tokens into yield farms to earn further APY rewards. This creates extra incentive for users to continue to be part of the liquidity pool over time.\n\n\nUsers of Ethereum-based apps like SushiSwap have to pay transaction fees (also called gas) that can vary widely in price and can make it expensive to use the network. DEXs have a range of risks, so do your research. “Impermanent loss” can result from pairing a more volatile cryptocurrency with a less volatile one in a liquidity pool. Bugs in smart contracts can be exploited. And anyone can create a token, so watch out for “rug pulls.” \nSynthetix is a crypto protocol that allows users to create crypto assets called Synths that track the price of other assets — anything from stocks and commodities to “index fund”-like baskets of assets or other cryptocurrencies. \nSynthetix also allows investors to buy and sell Synths, potentially making it possible to gain exposure to a huge range of investment opportunities without the need for a traditional brokerage account, bank, or fund manager. \nThe platform allows users to create synthetic assets called Synths on the Ethereum blockchain. Synths, in the form of ERC-20 , track the value of their underlying assets. The price data is fed acquired from Chainlink oracles (see the Chainlink entry in this guide).\nTo create new Synths, users provide collateral in the form of SNX — the platform’s native token. SNX holders are also incentivised to actively participate in maintaining the health of the system via . \nSynths can provide exposure to the underlying asset’s price, but investing in a Synth isn’t the same as owning the asset itself — for one, you don’t gain any of the voting rights that shareholders may receive.\nVoting on proposed changes and upgrades to the protocol is conducted via a process called “baking”, in which users lock up XTZ tokens to secure governance rights. This process is a form of .\nTezos was among the first projects to incorporate go “fully decentralized”, allowing token-holders to vote on changes to the protocol that would automatically be integrated by smart contract, drastically reducing the chances for disputes and hard forks. It launched off of the back of record-breaking $232M token sale in 2017. \nCryptocurrencies are now used to make payments, to engage with decentralized services and tools, and to store value. But they tend to have a trait that limits their day-to-day usability: volatility. Even Bitcoin, which has seen less volatility compared to its earliest years, moves too much relative to fiat currencies to be a comfortable everyday currency for most users.\nA new class of cryptocurrencies called “stablecoins” have their price fixed to a reserve asset (often the US dollar) at a one-to-one ratio. , as its name would suggest, is one such dollar-pegged cryptocurrency. The launch of USDC was powered by a collaboration between Coinbase and Circle through the co-founding of the CENTRE Consortium.\nUSDC can be redeemed on a one-to-one basis for the US dollar, and is backed by dollar-denominated assets held in segregated accounts with US regulated financial institutions. Its goal is to make crypto payments via the blockchain more reliable by reducing price fluctuations.\nUSDC is a token on Algorand, , , Base, Celo, Ethereum, Flow, , , Noble, OP Mainnet, Polkadot, Polygon PoS, Solana, and Stellar. It can be used to facilitate blockchain payments and transfer of value in the context of Ethereum smart contracts. This allows users to keep cryptocurrencies in a wallet, ready to send to a friend or interact with decentralized financial tools and services, and with minimal exposure to the risk of their holdings falling in price before they get a chance to spend them.\nBy providing assurances that token holders can redeem one USDC for exactly one US dollar at any time, the potential for price speculation is significantly reduced – resulting in a crypto asset that maintains a fixed value.\nwas one of the first applications to gain significant traction on Ethereum. Since then, numerous other have launched (including Curve, Sushiswap, and Balancer), but Uniswap remains among the most popular, with over $2 trillion in as of April 2024. Uniswap allows users anywhere in the world to trade crypto without an intermediary (but doesn’t allow for crypto-fiat trades, or vice versa). Users can also become liquidity pool providers, supplying a pair of two cryptocurrencies in order to receive rewards whenever anyone utilizes that pool. \n  * Uniswap pioneered the Automated Market Maker model, in which users supply Ethereum tokens to Uniswap “liquidity pools” and algorithms set market prices (as opposed to order books, which match bids and asks on a centralized exchange like Coinbase) . \n\n\nOne issue users of Ethereum-based apps like Uniswap face are transaction fees (also called gas) that can vary widely in price and can make it expensive to use the network. To address this, various solutions have emerged. These include the introduction of \",\" a new Ethereum upgrade, and the development of \"Layer 2\" scaling solutions like and . These advancements have significantly reduces transaction costs on Ethereum. Uniswap also launched its V3 with the goal of making transactions faster and cheaper.\nDEXs have a range of risks, so do your research. “Impermanent loss” can result from pairing a more volatile cryptocurrency with a less volatile one in a liquidity pool. Bugs in smart contracts can be exploited. And anyone can create a token, so watch out for “rug pulls.” \nYFI is an Ethereum-based token that powers Yearn.finance — which is designed to simplify the process of depositing funds into DeFi projects. DeFi typically requires a fairly high degree of technical knowledge. Yearn.finance (or yEarn) aims to solve this by creating a simple, streamlined portal via which less technically-skilled users can access DeFi platforms. Think of it as a “robo-advisor” of sorts.\nyEarn aims to be a sophisticated “yield farming” automation tool with a streamlined interface. It automatically moves funds supplied by investors between the liquidity pools of various DeFi projects via smart contract, in order to achieve the highest possible return for investors. \nIt also enables investors to use automation to drive decisions about which projects they should invest their funds into in order to get the best deal possible and maximize their profits.\nYFI is a governance token, which means that holders are able to vote on changes to the protocol’s structure or operational model. It has only been rarely distributed to users, but existing YFI can be bought or sold like any other cryptocurrency. \nis known as a “privacy coin” due to its focus on anonymity for users and the transactions they make on the blockchain. It was developed by cryptography experts to address what they saw as privacy issues with the Bitcoin network.\nenables a range of public and private transaction types. Public addresses can send “shielded” transactions to private addresses, or . ZCash makes use of Zero-Knowledge proofs (or “zk-SNARKS”) in order to keep information about the sender, receiver, and the transacted amount private whenever a “shielded” ZEC transaction is made. An optional “Memo” field can also be filled in whenever a user makes a payment. This field can only be accessed by the recipient, which could prove useful for a number of interesting use cases across the FinTech and DeFi spaces.\nThe Zcash protocol was designed to evolve in-line with the needs of the community over time. Governed by the Zcash Improvement Proposal process, ZCash holders can vote towards proposed changes and upgrades to the protocol.\nInformation provided on this Site is for general educational purposes only and is not intended to constitute investment or other advice on financial products.

      "markdown": "Volatility is a measure of how much the price of an asset has moved up or down over time. Generally, the more volatile an asset is, the riskier it’s considered to be as an investment — and the more potential it has to offer either higher returns or higher losses over shorter periods of time than comparatively less volatile assets.\nVolatility is a measure of how much the price of any particular asset has moved up or down over time. Generally, the more volatile an asset is, the riskier it’s considered to be as an investment — and the more potential it has to offer either higher returns or higher losses over shorter periods of time than comparatively less volatile assets. \nAs a newer asset class, crypto is widely considered to be volatile — with the potential for significant upward and downward movements over shorter time periods. Stocks are considered to have a wide range of volatility, from the relative stability of large-cap stocks (like Apple or Berkshire Hathaway) to often erratic “penny stocks.” Bonds, by contrast, are considered to be a lower-volatility asset — and typically see less dramatic upward and downward swings that take place over longer time frames.\n(often 30 days or a year). The prediction of future movements is called “implied volatility” — and because nobody can actually predict the future it’s a less exact science (although it’s the basis for widely used financial tools like the Cboe Volatility Index, nicknamed the “fear index,” which predicts the next 30 days’ stock market volatility). Quantifying volatility can be done a couple of ways: \n\n\nTraditionally, investors will take on a high level of risk if they believe the potential reward is worth the possibility of losing some of their investment. (Or of their investment, as in the of high-risk hedge-fund manager Bill Hwang, whose entire $20 billion dollar fund disappeared in two days.) \n  * Traditionally, retail investors are advised to diversify their investments within an asset class as a way of reducing risk. One popular strategy is to invest in a basket of stocks (or an ), rather than just a few. To further reduce the potential for downside, they may also pair investments in more volatile asset classes like stocks with investments in less volatile classes like bonds. \n\n\n  * As an asset class that’s , crypto has seen a series of steep rises and subsequent falls — and is considered to be more volatile as a category than stocks. That said, on (by far the biggest cryptocurrency by market cap) and increased institutional participation seem to be reducing its volatility over time. or emerging cryptoassets like tokens tend to have higher volatility — when experimenting with these assets as a beginner it’s best to risk amounts you can afford to lose. \n\n\n  * Factors that can increase volatility include positive or negative news coverage and earnings reports that are better or worse than expected. Unusually high spikes in volume of trading will usually correspond to volatility. Very low volume (as seen with so-called penny stocks that don’t trade on major markets or smaller cryptocurrencies) also usually corresponds with high volatility.\n\n\nFor some crypto investors, high volatility is part of the appeal — it creates the possibility for high returns. (And even as ’s volatility seems to be declining, it often moves by double-digit percentages in a single week, allowing for strategies like “buying the dip.”) \nFor less risk-tolerant investors, there are strategies that can be used to limit the downside impact of volatility, like . (Generally, investors with longer-term strategies who have good reason to believe that an investment will ultimately rise over time don’t need to think as much about short-term volatility.) And there are now cryptocurrencies specifically designed to have low volatility called (including and ) — these have their price pegged to a reserve asset like the U.S. dollar.\nInformation provided on this Site is for general educational purposes only and is not intended to constitute investment or other advice on financial products.

      "markdown": "\n\nA cryptocurrency is a digital currency secured by cryptography. It’s a digital asset typically used as a medium of exchange. Cryptocurrencies can operate globally, 24/7, and independently of intermediaries such as banks and payment processors.\nLike traditional fiat currencies, cryptocurrencies can be used as a medium of exchange. However, the use cases for cryptocurrencies have expanded significantly over the years and now include a wide range of applications in various industries, such as decentralized finance (\nEach computer node has to maintain a local copy of the blockchain and update its copy every time new data is added to the ledger. Once validated and confirmed, cryptocurrency transactions are permanently recorded in the blockchain database.\nThe distributed architecture increases the network’s security because there is no single point of failure for malicious actors to exploit. If a node tries to validate invalid transactions or misbehaves, they are quickly expelled from the network.\nThe blockchain is a chain of linked blocks, so you can think of a block as one of the many pages in the blockchain ledger. Each block contains, among other things, a unique list of crypto transactions.\nCryptocurrencies allow users to have total control over their assets. Their decentralized architecture eliminates the need for a central authority.

      "markdown": "  * Bitcoin is the very first cryptocurrency ever created. It was introduced via a whitepaper in 2008 and officially launched in January 2009. Bitcoin’s creator is only known by the pseudonym \n\n\nThink of Bitcoin as cash for the internet. It was the first digital currency ever invented, introduced to the world in 2008 and launched a few months later in 2009. It lets you send money directly to someone else without needing a middleman.\nIt's worth noting that people usually write \"Bitcoin\" with a capital B when talking about the network or the technology, and \"bitcoin\" with a lowercase b when talking about the coins themselves. The ticker symbol you see on exchanges is BTC.\nUnlike the dollars or euros in your wallet, which are printed and controlled by governments, Bitcoin is decentralized. This just means no single boss, bank, or government runs the Bitcoin network. It’s a peer-to-peer system.\nWhy do people like Bitcoin so much? You can own and control your money. You can use Bitcoin to send money anywhere, anytime, without relying on an intermediary. The system is also immune to \nEvery time a transaction happens, it gets written onto a \"block.\" That block is linked to the previous one, forming a chain. This record is copied onto thousands of computers around the world (called \nBecause so many computers have a copy of the notebook, nobody can cheat. If one person tries to change the numbers to give themselves more money, the other computers reject it. Also, anyone can participate in the ecosystem by downloading Bitcoin's \n\n\nThe blockchain updates to show that Alice has 1 less BTC and Bob has 1 more. It’s like Alice writing on a public billboard, \"I gave Bob 1 Bitcoin,\" so everyone knows the money moved.\nWhen Bob wants to send that money to Carol later, the network checks the history to make sure he actually received it from Alice first. Everyone’s ledger stays in sync because the computers are constantly talking to each other.\nMining is how the network stays secure. It’s also how new bitcoins are brought into the world. When you send a transaction, it gets broadcast to the network. Then, users known as miners pick up these transactions and group them into a block.\nTo add this block to the blockchain, they must solve a specific puzzle. The first miner to solve the puzzle gets to add the block and is rewarded with brand new bitcoins. This reward is the only way new bitcoins are created.\nWhen we talk about a “puzzle” that miners have to solve, we are basically talking about PoW. It was designed to make it expensive to create a block, but cheap to verify that it's valid. Suppose someone tries to cheat with an invalid block. In that case, the network immediately rejects it and the miner is unable to recover the cost of mining.\nBecause PoW requires a lot of computational power, it consumes a large amount of electricity. This has led to debates regarding Bitcoin's environmental impact. However, in more recent years, the mining industry has shifted heavily toward using renewable energy sources and stranded energy that would otherwise go to waste.\n. It can be used to make purchases online or in person, similar to traditional currencies. More and more businesses are accepting Bitcoin as a payment method, from online retailers to brick-and-mortar stores.\nWhile the main Bitcoin network (Layer 1) can sometimes be slow or expensive for small purchases, \"Layer 2\" solutions like the Lightning Network have been developed to address such limitations.\nAs an investment, many buy BTC hoping its value will continue to rise. While the price of bitcoin can be volatile, some investors see it as a way to diversify their portfolios and hedge against inflation in the long term.\nBitcoin was first seen in October 2008 when Satoshi Nakamoto published a whitepaper entitled \"Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System\". This paper introduced a new digital currency that would operate on a decentralized system without relying on governments or the banking system.\nIn January 2009, the Bitcoin protocol was officially launched with the mining of the \"Genesis Block.\" The first bitcoin transaction took place between Satoshi Nakamoto and a programmer named Hal Finney. The transaction involved sending ten bitcoins from Nakamoto to Finney.\nAfter the first transaction, more people began to discover Bitcoin and join the network. The digital currency gained popularity among a small community of tech enthusiasts by demonstrating that Bitcoin could function without a central authority or intermediary.\nBitcoin Pizza is another important milestone in the history of Bitcoin, as it marked the first time bitcoins were used as a medium of exchange for a real-world transaction. On May 22, 2010, a programmer named Laszlo Hanyecz made history by using 10,000 bitcoins to buy two pizzas. The transaction became known as \"Bitcoin Pizza Day\" and is now commemorated every year on May 22.\nSatoshi Nakamoto's identity remains a mystery. Satoshi could be a person or a group of developers anywhere in the world. The name is of Japanese origin, but Satoshi's mastery of English has led many to believe that he or she is from an English-speaking country. Despite many theories and investigations over the years, the true identity of the creator remains unconfirmed.\nBitcoin combines a number of existing technologies that have been around for a long time, and this includes blockchain technology. The use of such immutable data structures can be traced back to the early 1990s when Stuart Haber and W. Scott Stornetta proposed a system for time-stamping documents. \nBitcoin also uses Merkle Trees, a concept developed by Ralph Merkle. Much like today's blockchains, these early systems relied on cryptographic techniques to secure data and prevent it from being tampered with. But Bitcoin was revolutionary in combining these technologies to solve the double-spending issue that plagued other digital payment systems at the time.\nThe protocol sets the maximum supply of bitcoins at 21 million coins. As of January 2026, just over 95% of these have been mined, but it will take over a hundred years to produce the rest. This is due to periodic events known as \nBitcoin halving refers to the periodic halving events that reduce the block rewards offered to miners. The next Bitcoin halving is expected to happen in 2028, roughly four years after the last halving, which took place on April 19, 2024.\nBitcoin halving is at the core of its economic model as it ensures that coins are issued at a steady pace, getting increasingly difficult at a predictable rate. Such a controlled rate of monetary inflation is one of the key differences between Bitcoin and traditional \nattacks. Hackers can infect a user's computer or mobile device with malware that allows them to access the user's Bitcoin wallet. In some cases, hackers can also use ransomware to encrypt a user's files and demand payment in bitcoins to unlock them.\nBecause bitcoin transactions are irreversible and not insured by any government agency, users must take precautions to protect their bitcoin holdings. This includes using strong passwords, two-factor authentication, and using \"cold storage\" or hardware wallets (devices that keep keys offline) to ensure funds are inaccessible to online hackers. It's also important to only download Bitcoin-related software from trusted sources.\n. The value of bitcoin can fluctuate highly over short periods of time, making it a risky investment for those who are not prepared for the price fluctuations and potential losses. But historically, volatility has tended to decrease as the asset matures and market liquidity increases.\nBitcoin has come a long way from its humble beginnings, growing into a globally recognized cryptocurrency with numerous use cases and increasing institutional adoption. Whether you’re considering using Bitcoin for everyday transactions, short-term trading, investing for the future, or simply interested in the technology, it’s certainly worth learning more about it.\n_Disclaimer: This content is presented to you on an “as is” basis for general information and educational purposes only, without representation or warranty of any kind.

      "markdown": "\n\nBlockchain technology has transformed industries, especially finance, by introducing a decentralized, transparent, and secure way of managing data and transactions. While it began as the foundation for cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, its applications have grown to include supply chain management, healthcare, voting systems, and much more.\nA blockchain is a special kind of database. It’s a decentralized digital ledger that’s maintained by a distributed network of computers. Blockchain data is organized into blocks, which are chronologically arranged and secured by cryptography.\nThis structure ensures that the data is transparent, secure, and immutable. It’s virtually impossible to change data stored in a block after the block is confirmed and added to the chain. The decentralized structure also removes the need for a central authority. Blockchain transactions can happen between users without the need for intermediaries.\nwas created in the early 1990s when computer scientist Stuart Haber and physicist W. Scott Stornetta employed cryptographic techniques in a chain of blocks as a way to secure digital documents from data tampering.\n\n\nDecentralization in blockchain refers to the idea that the control and decision-making power of a network is distributed among its users rather than controlled by a single entity, such as a bank, government, or corporation.\nIn a decentralized blockchain network, there’s no central authority or intermediary that controls the flow of data or transactions. Instead, transactions are verified and recorded by a distributed network of computers that work together to maintain the integrity of the network.\nand other transaction data. Once the transaction is verified, it's added to a block along with other transactions. We can think of each block as a page of the digital ledger.\n\n\nTo add a block to the chain, participants in the network must agree on its validity. This is achieved using a consensus algorithm, such as Proof of Work (PoW) and Proof of Stake (PoS). We will discuss both in more detail soon, but here is a brief summary:\n\n\nOnce validated, the block is added to the blockchain. Each subsequent block references the previous one, ensuring a tamper-proof structure. In other words, for a new block to be validated, it must use the previous block identifier.\nThe hash functions used in blockchains are generally collision-resistant, meaning that the odds of finding two pieces of data that produce the same output are astronomically small. Another feature is called the avalanche effect, referring to the phenomenon that any slight change in the input data would produce a drastically different output. \nLet's illustrate this with SHA256, a function used in Bitcoin. As you can see, changing the capitalization of the letters caused the output to be dramatically different. Hash functions are also one-way functions because it’s computationally infeasible to arrive at the input data by reverse engineering the hash output.\nEach block within a blockchain securely contains the hash of the preceding block, establishing a robust chain of blocks. Anyone wanting to alter one block would need to modify all the succeeding blocks, a task that is not only technically challenging but also prohibitively costly.\nThis is how it works. Each participant has a unique pair of keys: a private key, which they keep secret, and a public key, which is openly shared. When a user initiates a transaction, they sign it using their private key, creating a digital signature.\nOther users in the network can then verify the transaction's authenticity by applying the sender's public key to the digital signature. This approach ensures secure transactions because only the legitimate owner of the private key can authorize a transaction, and everyone can verify the signatures using the public key.\nis a mechanism that allows users or machines to coordinate in a distributed setting. It needs to ensure that all agents in the system can agree on a single source of truth, even if some agents fail. \nWhen tens of thousands of nodes keep a copy of the blockchain's data, some challenges can quickly arise, including data consistency and malicious nodes. To ensure the integrity of the blockchain, there are various consensus mechanisms that govern how network nodes reach an agreement. Let's take a closer look at the major consensus mechanisms.\nProof of Work (PoW) is a consensus mechanism used in many blockchain networks to verify transactions and maintain the integrity of the blockchain. It's the original consensus mechanism used by Bitcoin.\nMiners must use powerful computers to solve mathematical problems, mine new coins, and secure the network. This is why the mining process requires significant amounts of resources (computational power and energy). \nProof of Stake (PoS) is a consensus mechanism designed to address some of the drawbacks of Proof of Work (PoW). In a PoS system, instead of miners competing to solve complex mathematical problems to validate transactions and add new blocks to the blockchain, validators are chosen based on the amount of cryptocurrency they \"stake\" in the network.\nThe stake represents the amount of crypto held by validators as collateral. Usually, PoS validators are randomly selected to create new blocks and validate transactions based on the size of their stake. They are rewarded with transaction fees for creating new blocks and as an incentive to act in the best interest of the network. If they act maliciously, they risk losing their staked crypto.\n) is similar to PoS, but instead of all validators being eligible to create new blocks, token holders elect a smaller set of delegates to do so on their behalf.\n), validators are identified by their reputation or identity rather than the amount of cryptocurrency they hold. Validators are selected based on their trustworthiness and can be removed from the network if they act maliciously.\nA public blockchain is a decentralized network that is open to anyone who wants to participate. These networks are typically open-source, transparent, and permissionless, meaning that anyone can access and use them. Bitcoin and Ethereum are examples of public blockchains.\nA private blockchain, as the name suggests, is a blockchain network that is not open to the public. Private blockchains are typically run by a single entity, such as a company, and are used for internal purposes and use cases.\nPrivate blockchains are permissioned environments with established rules that dictate who can see and write to the chain. They are not decentralized systems because there is a clear hierarchy of control. However, they can be distributed in that many nodes maintain a copy of the chain on their machines.\nA consortium blockchain is a hybrid of public and private blockchains. In a consortium blockchain, multiple organizations come together to create a shared blockchain network that is jointly managed and governed. These networks can be either open or closed, depending on the needs of the consortium members.\nInstead of an open system where anyone can validate blocks or a closed system where only a single entity designates block producers, a consortium chain sees a handful of equally powerful parties acting as validators. \nThe rules of the system are flexible: visibility of the chain can be limited to validators, visible to authorized individuals, or visible to all. If the validators can reach a consensus, changes can be easily implemented. As for how the blockchain works, if a certain threshold of these parties behave honestly, the system won't run into problems.\nSmart contracts are self-executing contracts that can be programmed to execute automatically when certain conditions are met. Blockchain technology enables the creation and execution of smart contracts in a secure and decentralized manner.\n) and organizations (DAOs), which are a big part of decentralized finance (DeFi) platforms. DeFi platforms leverage blockchain to provide financial services like lending, borrowing, and trading without traditional institutions. This democratizes access to financial tools.\nBlockchain can be used to create secure and tamper-proof digital identities that can be used to verify personal information and other sensitive data. This could become increasingly important as more of our personal information and assets move online.\nBy providing a decentralized, tamper-proof ledger of all votes cast, blockchain technology can be used to create a secure and transparent voting system that eliminates the possibility of voter fraud and ensures the integrity of the voting process.\nBlockchain technology offers a secure and transparent way to record transactions and store data. It’s a technology that is revolutionizing industries by bringing a new level of trust and security to the digital world.\nWhether enabling peer-to-peer transactions, creating new forms of digital assets, or facilitating decentralized applications, blockchain technology opens up a world of possibilities. As the technology continues to evolve and gain wider adoption, we can expect more innovative and transformative use cases to emerge in the coming years.\nDisclaimer: This content is presented to you on an “as is” basis for general information and educational purposes only, without representation or warranty of any kind.

      "markdown": "  * Ethereum originally operated on a Proof of Work (PoW) consensus mechanism, much like Bitcoin. However, the network transitioned to Proof of Stake (PoS) in 2022 for improved energy efficiency and scalability.\n\n\nEthereum, conceptualized in 2014 by programmer Vitalik Buterin, is a decentralized, open-source platform powered by blockchain technology. Unlike Bitcoin, which is mainly about sending digital money, Ethereum lets people build all kinds of applications and services, such as games, financial products, digital art collections, and much more.\n, was conceived primarily as a digital alternative to traditional currencies. Bitcoin is envisioned as a decentralized form of money immune to governmental interference or inflation. Its primary function is to serve as a medium of exchange, a \nEthereum, on the other hand, was created in 2014 by Vitalik Buterin with a broader vision. While it does have its own cryptocurrency, ether (ETH), Ethereum's purpose extends beyond facilitating transactions. It's designed as a platform for developers to build and deploy smart contracts and decentralized applications (\nWhile Bitcoin does offer a form of smart contract functionality, Ethereum is more flexible and generalized, allowing for an array of applications. These allow for programmable transactions and a multitude of applications beyond currency transfers.\nBitcoin has a capped supply, with a maximum of 21 million coins ever to be mined into existence. This scarcity principle is one of its core value propositions. Ethereum, in contrast, doesn't have a hard-capped supply.\nIn summary, while both Bitcoin and Ethereum leverage blockchain technology, they cater to different domains. Bitcoin aims to disrupt the way we perceive and use money, while Ethereum seeks to revolutionize how applications and agreements function in a decentralized setting.\nEthereum is a bit complicated, but it’s made up of a few main parts: the blockchain, smart contracts, a special computer called the Ethereum Virtual Machine, a way to agree on transactions, and fees for using the network. Let’s look at each one.\n, that work together to keep it accurate. Every transaction, like sending ETH or using an app, gets put into a “block.” These blocks are connected in a chain, which is why it’s called a blockchain.\nBecause the blockchain is shared and public, anyone can see what’s happening. It’s also built to be safe, so it’s hard for anyone to cheat or change the records. Ethereum uses a special way to organize data, called a \nSmart contracts are one of Ethereum’s coolest features. They’re like automatic agreements that do what they’re supposed to without needing someone to manage them. For example, if you put money into a smart contract to buy a digital item, it will send the item to you and the money to the seller automatically. Another example is a smart contract that automatically sends out a message whenever someone sends ETH tokens.\n. They power all kinds of apps, like ones that let you borrow money, trade digital art, or even vote in a group. They’re super useful but need to be coded carefully to avoid mistakes.\n, is like the brain of Ethereum. It’s a virtual computer made up of all the nodes in the network. When someone makes a smart contract or app, the EVM runs it to make sure it works right. It’s what lets Ethereum handle complicated tasks, not just simple money transfers.\nfees,” and they go to the people who keep the network running. Developers have to write smart contracts in a way that doesn't use too much gas, or they may get too expensive to use.\nor lock up as collateral. In other words, people stake their ETH (kind of like putting down a deposit) to help run the network. If they do a good job, they earn rewards. If they try to cheat, they lose their ETH. This new way offers increased scalability and energy efficiency.\nEvery time you do something on Ethereum, like send ETH or use an app, you pay a small fee called gas. Gas is paid in tiny bits of ETH, called \nGas fees have two parts: a base fee that gets destroyed (taken out of circulation) and a tip that goes to the people running the network. Destroying fees helps keep the amount of ETH from growing too fast. Gas fees are usually under $1, but they can go up when the network is busy. You can use sites like \nPhase 1/1.5 was the combination of two phases. Phase 1 introduced shard chains, which enabled validators to create blocks on the blockchain through PoS. Phase 1.5 began rolling out in 2021 and marked the official transition from PoW to PoS.\nPhase 2, the final phase, enabled Ethereum 2.0 to support fully formed shards and become the official Ethereum network. Shard chains also work with smart contracts, allowing seamless integration of DApps and other technologies with Ethereum 2.0.\nBuilding on the foundational changes introduced by Ethereum 2.0, the Pectra upgrade represents the next major step in Ethereum’s ongoing evolution. Released 7 May 2025, Pectra combines two previously planned upgrades-Prague (execution layer) and Electra (consensus layer) into a single, comprehensive update that focuses on improving network scalability, user experience, and staking efficiency.\n  * Pectra significantly raises the maximum amount of ETH a validator can stake from 32 ETH to 2,048 ETH (EIP-7251). This allows large stakers to consolidate multiple validator slots into one, simplifying validator management and improving capital efficiency without forcing smaller validators out.\n  * : The upgrade introduces smart contract capabilities to externally owned accounts (EIP-7702), enabling wallets to batch transactions and pay gas fees using tokens other than ETH, such as stablecoins like USDC. This greatly enhances wallet usability and lowers onboarding friction for new users.\n  *   * \n\ncompleted by Ethereum 2.0 and subsequent upgrades like Shanghai and Dencun, refining the network’s infrastructure to make Ethereum more scalable, efficient, and user-friendly. This upgrade not only improves the staking experience, potentially attracting more institutional participation, but also enhances transaction flexibility and wallet functionality paving the way for broader adoption and future innovations such as Verkle trees.\nSince the inception of Ethereum, countless applications and products have been developed on the platform, making it the second most popular cryptocurrency. Here are some of the most common use cases and features.\n  * US President Donald Trump’s 2025 tariffs have created market uncertainty. These tariffs, announced in March and April 2025, have spooked investors, who seem to be moving away from risky assets like ETH to safer investments like gold.\n  * Investors worry that tariff wars could lead to a US recession, reducing demand for volatile assets like ETH. This “risk-off” sentiment has slashed the crypto market’s total capitalization by $800 billion since January 2025.\n\n\n  * \n\n  * : Sharp price drops, like the 5% decline to $1,900 on March 28, 2025, were driven by forced liquidations of leveraged positions. Over $88.7 million in long ETH positions were wiped out in a single day, accelerating the downturn.\n  * ) have seen consistent outflows. In April 2025, ETFs recorded $94.1 million in net outflows over two weeks, with $3.3 million exiting on April 8 alone. This contrasts with Bitcoin ETFs, which have seen stronger inflows.\n\n\nWhile Ethereum’s role in DeFi and NFTs remains strong, these challenges, combined with Bitcoin’s dominance and broader crypto market declines, are making it hard for the ETH price to recover. A rebound may depend on better network activity combined with an easing of global economic tensions.\n. Ethereum is supported by all major centralized and decentralized exchanges. You can create your account at an exchange you trust, deposit fiat or cryptocurrencies, and then use them to buy ETH.\nAs with any investment, it depends on things like your risk tolerance, financial situation, goals, and time horizon. ETH can be a highly volatile investment, and its price will likely vary according to the long-term performance of the project and the crypto markets as a whole. You should conduct your own research to determine if ETH is a good investment for you.\nto cash out your ETH. You can create your exchange account and link your bank account to it. Once this has been done, you can send ETH to your exchange account from an Ethereum-compatible wallet. Once the ETH has arrived, you can place an order to sell it and then transfer the fiat currency to the linked bank account.\n. If you lose your funds or access to your wallet, chances are you won’t be able to recover your crypto.

It can operate without the need for intermediaries, leveraging blockchain technology for increased security and transparency, providing users with a way to enforce agreements and streamline various processes.\nSmart contracts are particularly useful for two parties to transact directly with each other without needing to engage a third party to ensure the contract is honored by the buyer and seller. Let’s say you’re in the market for a piece of digital art. Traditionally, this transaction might require an art gallery to act as the intermediary. \nInstead of relying on this middleman, a smart contract uses computer code to execute and enforce the terms of the agreement. You can think of it as a virtual \"if-then\" statement. For example, \nSmart contracts have applications that go beyond simple transactions. They can increase blockchain's potential for mainstream adoption by enabling new use cases that traditional systems cannot support. Current use cases include:\nAs discussed, smart contracts in crypto can be used for automated and secure financial transactions, such as transferring digital currencies, making payments, and executing more complex financial agreements in a peer-to-peer manner. \nSmart contracts can simplify insurance processes by automating claims processing, verifying eligibility, and facilitating payouts based on predefined conditions. This can reduce paperwork, improve efficiency, and enhance transparency in the insurance industry.\nSmart contracts can track and verify the movement of goods throughout the supply chain, ensuring transparency, traceability, and reducing fraud. They can automate supply chain management processes such as order fulfillment, payment settlement, and quality control.\nSmart contracts, often through NFTs, can manage the ownership and distribution of intellectual property, such as music, art, or written content. Smart contracts allow creators to define licensing terms, automate royalty payments, and ensure fair distribution of digital assets.\nSmart contracts can facilitate secure and transparent voting systems by ensuring the integrity of votes, preventing fraud, and enabling instant tabulation of results. This can help increase trust and transparency in democratic processes.\nThe smart contract contains code that defines the terms, rules, and conditions of a specific agreement, program, or transaction. These terms can be as simple as a single payment or as complex as a multi-step process with many participants and data point requirements.\nOnce deployed, anyone with access to the blockchain can invoke the smart contract by interacting with it. Invoking a smart contract typically involves calling specific functions within the contract and providing the necessary inputs.\nWhen a smart contract is invoked, the transaction will be verified and validated by the blockchain network. If the conditions specified in the contract are met, the task is automatically executed.\nOnce the conditions are validated and the transaction is confirmed, it’s recorded as an immutable entry on the blockchain database. Typically, this entry includes all the relevant details of the transaction, making it transparent, auditable, and verifiable.\nThe execution of a smart contract is final and cannot be reversed, as it's stored on a decentralized and tamper-resistant database (the blockchain ledger). This ensures the transaction's integrity and security, reducing the risk of fraud or unauthorized modifications.\n  * : BSC’s programming language is similar to Ethereum’s, making it popular for developers who might want to migrate their projects from one platform to another.

Errors in code implementation or design can lead to security vulnerabilities that may result in financial loss or other negative consequences. Smart contracts need to undergo rigorous testing before being deployed to avoid exposing users to these dangers.\nScalability and performance issues may arise if blockchain networks grow in size and usage. The limitations of blockchain networks can impact the speed and efficiency of smart contract execution, particularly in high-demand scenarios.\nThe immutability of smart contracts is a double-edged sword. Once deployed and executed, a smart contract cannot be modified or reversed. While it can enhance security, it can also be problematic if there are errors or bugs in the code or if the contract needs to be updated due to changing circumstances.\nMany crypto platforms run bug bounty programs with large rewards to encourage white hat hackers, developers, and researchers to identify and report vulnerabilities in smart contract code before they can be exploited.

Their goal is to follow best practices to ensure secure coding standards, including testing, code reviews, and \nFurthermore, there’s a common goal among developers to create tools, frameworks, and standards to improve smart contract development practices. One way to do this is through standardization efforts aimed at establishing common interfaces, protocols, and formats for smart contracts. \nEfforts such as ERC (Ethereum Request for Comments) standards help establish widely accepted interfaces for smart contracts and thus can improve interoperability between different blockchain platforms, making it easier to integrate smart contracts with other protocols and enabling seamless interactions.\nare Layer-2 solutions that may address such concerns.

However, they also present a few challenges, including security flaws and scalability. As such, the crypto community and individual protocols are actively working to address these drawbacks through continuous testing, security measures, and ongoing development efforts. \n_Disclaimer: This article is for educational purposes only.

Paper wallets, which are pieces of paper with a written or printed code, are considered outdated and unreliable.\n\n\nA crypto wallet is a tool that allows you to interact with blockchain networks to manage your cryptocurrencies and other digital assets. Your crypto wallet keeps track of how much cryptocurrency you have and lets you send and receive digital assets.\nIn addition to storing and managing your cryptocurrency, crypto wallets also allow you to connect to decentralized applications (DApps), such as decentralized exchanges (DEXs) and play-to-earn games. You will also need a crypto wallet to store and manage non-fungible tokens (\nContrary to popular belief, crypto wallets don't actually store digital assets. Instead, they provide the tools necessary to access and spend your crypto holdings. In other words, crypto wallets generate the necessary information to send and receive assets via \nas a “specific location\" on the blockchain to which coins can be sent. Similar to how you share your email address with others to receive messages, you can share your wallet’s public address with others to receive funds.\nregardless of which wallet you use. So, even if your computer or smartphone is lost, you can still access your funds on another device — as long as you have the appropriate private key or \nare managed by third parties, such as crypto exchanges, which store and manage the private keys on your behalf. These wallets prioritize convenience, allowing you to recover funds more easily if you forget your password or lose access. However, custodial wallets require trust in the custodian’s security and reliability because you won’t be fully in control of your assets.\n, on the other hand, grant you full control over your seed phrases and private keys, ensuring complete ownership of your cryptocurrency. This independence enhances security and privacy but comes with greater responsibility. If your keys are lost or compromised, recovery is nearly impossible.\nCrypto wallets are essential tools for the secure storage and management of digital assets. The non-custodial types provide users with full control, ownership, and direct access to their funds, promoting financial independence and eliminating the need for intermediaries.\nUnlike traditional financial systems where banks or intermediaries store your funds for you, non-custodial crypto wallets give you full control to store and manage your own money. You hold the private keys that serve as proof of ownership and allow you to authorize transactions.\ntransactions, which can be advantageous in terms of speed and cost efficiency. It also allows individuals in underbanked or unbanked regions to access financial services and participate in the global economy.\nCrypto wallets allow you to access your funds anytime, anywhere, as long as you have an Internet connection. You can send and receive cryptocurrency, check your balance, and interact with DApps at all times. This accessibility is especially useful for individuals who are unbanked, want to take control of their finances or participate in the \nCrypto wallets are often compatible with multiple cryptocurrencies and blockchain networks. This interoperability allows you to manage various digital assets within a single interface. You can trade a wide range of cryptocurrencies, participate in \nCrypto wallets play an important role in driving the adoption and use of cryptocurrencies by providing a tool for individuals to engage with the crypto space. They aim to simplify the complex aspects of cryptocurrencies, making it easier for individuals, including non-technical users, to understand and manage their digital assets. User-friendly wallets attract newcomers to the crypto space, facilitating their entry into the ecosystem.\nChoosing the best crypto wallet depends on several factors, including the user's specific needs and preferences. The best crypto wallet may also depend on the specific cryptocurrency you want to hold and use. \nFor example, the best Bitcoin wallet may be different from the one needed to store Ethereum-based assets. In some cases, the crypto wallet may not be designed for the blockchain network you’re interested in, so you may not even be able to use it. \nHardware wallets are electronic devices that use a random number generator (RNG) to generate public and private keys. The keys are then stored on the device itself. Hardware storage is a type of cold wallet, meaning that it operates offline and isn’t connected to the Internet when storing and signing cryptocurrency transactions.\nThis isolation from online networks enhances the security of the private keys and protects them from potential online threats, such as hacking or malware attacks. By keeping private keys offline, hardware wallets provide an additional layer of protection, making them the preferred choice for individuals seeking increased security for their digital assets.\nWhile these wallets provide a higher level of security against online attacks, even the best crypto hardware wallet can present risks if the firmware implementation isn’t done properly. Hardware wallets also tend to be less user-friendly. Depending on the wallet, funds might be more difficult to access when compared to hot wallets (the ones that are connected to the Internet).\nConsider using a hardware wallet if you plan to hold your assets for a long time or if you're holding large amounts of cryptocurrency. Currently, most hardware wallets allow you to set up a PIN code to protect your device and a recovery phrase as a backup in case you forget your PIN or lose your wallet device.\nSoftware wallets come in a variety of forms, including web, desktop, and mobile wallets. They offer convenience and accessibility, but most are hot wallets, meaning they are connected to the Internet in some way.\nYou can use web wallets to access blockchains through a browser interface without downloading or installing software to your device. This includes both exchange wallets and other browser-based wallet providers.\nWhen using a crypto exchange, you will have a custodial wallet that is managed by the company. While exchange wallets are more convenient for inexperienced users, you are entrusting the service provider with your keys and assets. So, it’s important to choose a trustworthy and secure provider like Binance.\nAs the name implies, desktop wallets are software applications that users download and run locally on their computers. Unlike some web-based versions, desktop wallets provide complete control over keys and funds. \nfile and keep it in a safe place. Alternatively, you can export and back up the corresponding private keys or wallet seed phrase. This will allow you to access your funds on other devices if your computer stops working or becomes inaccessible.\nIn general, reputable desktop wallets are considered secure. However, it’s crucial to ensure your computer is free of viruses and malware before setting up and using a desktop wallet. Electrum is a popular example of a desktop crypto wallet.\nMobile wallets work much like their web and desktop counterparts but are specifically designed as smartphone applications. These are quite convenient as they allow you to use crypto on the move. You can also send and receive digital assets using QR codes.\nis a piece of paper on which a crypto address and its private key are physically printed out. These wallets are highly resistant to online hacking attacks and may be considered an alternative to cold storage. However, they require careful handling and secure storage to prevent loss or damage.\nPaper wallets were relatively popular prior to 2016, but their use is now discouraged due to their intrinsic risks. Paper wallets are subject to being damaged or destroyed fairly easily. There are also security risks associated with data that might be stored in computers and printers after generating a paper wallet.\nAnother danger of using paper wallets comes from the misconception that funds can be sent multiple times from the same address. For instance, if you send 4 out of 10 BTC from your paper wallet, the remaining 6 BTC will be automatically transferred to a “change address” that is different from your paper wallet address. In most cases, users lose access to the remaining funds (the change) because it’s not an address they control.\nResearch different types of wallets and consider factors such as wallet security, compatibility, user experience, custody, and community trust. Look for reputable wallet providers and read reviews to make an informed decision.\nOnce you've chosen a wallet, visit the wallet provider's official website. Make sure you’re on a legitimate website by verifying the URL. This is important because there are fraudulent websites that look almost identical to the legitimate ones. \nIf you decide to go with a crypto hardware wallet, you should also ensure that the wallet is sealed when it arrives and the packaging hasn’t been tampered with. Ideally, you should buy hardware wallets directly from the manufacturer to reduce risks.\nIf it's a software wallet, find the download section on the website and select the appropriate version for your operating system. After downloading, follow the installation instructions provided by the wallet provider.\nIf you purchased a hardware wallet, you will need to follow the manufacturer's instructions to set it up. This usually involves connecting the device to your computer or smartphone using the included cable (or Bluetooth), installing the necessary software, and updating the firmware.\nWhen you first launch the wallet software, you'll usually have the option to create a new wallet or import an existing one. If setting up a new wallet, follow the instructions to generate a new wallet address and private key. If you already have a wallet, select the import option and provide the necessary details, like the recovery phrase or private key.\nRemember to back up your wallet at this stage to protect it from loss or damage. Follow the wallet provider's instructions to back up your wallet's recovery phrase or create a wallet backup file. Store this backup securely in a separate location.\nIt's important to prioritize the security of your crypto wallet. Set a strong password for the wallet software and enable any additional security features offered by the wallet provider, such as biometric or two-factor authentication (2FA).\nTake some time to play around and explore the wallet interface and its features. Familiarize yourself with functions such as sending and receiving funds, viewing transaction history, and accessing additional settings.\n  1. Go to your new wallet and get the public address. It’s often displayed along with a QR code. Copy the destination wallet address and paste it into the address field of your Binance withdrawal page.\n\n\nThere is no definitive answer. If you‘re a frequent trader, using a mobile or web wallet will allow you to access your funds quickly and trade conveniently. Assuming you have a virus-free device and secured your account with 2FA methods, your crypto is generally safe.\na large amount of crypto that you don’t plan to sell for a long time, cold wallets might be a better alternative, as they are more resistant to hacking, phishing attacks, and scams.\n_Disclaimer: This content is presented to you on an “as is” basis for general information and educational purposes only, without representation or warranty of any kind.

      "markdown": "If you trade cryptocurrencies on centralized exchanges, use ones that are regulatory compliant with KYC and AML checks. Peer-to-peer trading and decentralized exchanges with audits have the best chance of security.\nThere are multiple options when it comes to storing your crypto securely. You can keep your crypto on a regulated exchange, which is practical for newcomers and traders. However, you don’t own the keys to the wallet. \nA non-custodial wallet where you own the keys provides more security, and the more secure option is to keep it in a wallet not connected to the internet like a cold storage device. In both cases, keep your private keys safe in an offline, secure place.\nAt the core of cryptocurrencies is the idea of self-sovereignty – the notion that a user can act as their own bank. Secure your funds properly, and they'll be harder to reach than even the most well-guarded of bank vaults. Fail to do so, and you run the risk of someone remotely emptying your digital wallet.\nLearning to secure your digital coins properly is a vital step as you journey down the cryptocurrency rabbit hole. It's not just all about storage, either. Nowadays, many cryptocurrency holders interact with DApps in the DeFi world, so you should also learn how to use your coins securely.\nJust like you wouldn't allow an untrustworthy business to handle your money, you also shouldn't trust your coins with any random DApp. The same goes for exchanges where you purchase and trade crypto. In this guide, we'll discuss some of the best techniques for keeping your crypto assets safe wherever they are.\noptions, and more. Not every choice offers the same amount of security, and each has its advantages and disadvantages. For most users, using reputable, centralized exchanges provides the best mix of ease-of-use and security.\nTo use an exchange, you'll need to transfer your funds into its custodial wallet. Giving the exchange responsibility for your coins can provide some security depending on your outlook. If you aren’t familiar with wallets or are new to cryptocurrencies, you may be more secure using the exchange’s wallet. This saves you from accidentally locking yourself out of your wallet and losing your crypto. \nHowever, some people prefer the security of controlling their funds directly. You may have already heard the phrase “not your keys, not your coins”. If you don’t actually own the wallet, then someone else can control your crypto. You can check our storage section later on for more information.\nIf you've decided on using a peer-to-peer service or a decentralized exchange, there are a few signs to look for to improve your security. With a DEX, check for an \nIf you need to use a peer-to-peer service, make sure it requires KYC for both buyers and sellers. Ideally, it should also offer an escrow service. While it doesn’t remove the risks completely, a third party holding your funds in escrow provides both the buyer and seller more protection from scams.\nIf you signed up for your exchange or chosen trading method, follow standard good practices to keep your account safe. These tips are no different from those you would use for your online bank account or other sensitive information. Preventing people from getting access to your account and its funds is easy by:\nThe password shouldn't include identifiable personal information like your date of birth, for example. Make sure it's also long, is unique to that account, and contains symbols, numbers, and lowercase and uppercase letters.\nOnce you've purchased or traded some crypto and secured your account, your next priority should be placing it somewhere safe. If you're not leaving it on the exchange to trade later, the only other option is a \nThe key is just a really long number – so large that it would be impossible for anyone to guess. If you flip a coin 256 times and write down \"1\" for heads, \"0\" for tails, you'll end up with a private key. Here's one we've just generated. It's encoded in hexadecimal (using numbers 0-9 and characters a-f) for a more compact representation:\nIf you look that number up on Google, you'll see the only occurrence is in this article (unless it's been subsequently copied elsewhere). That should give you an idea of how truly random the number is – the odds of anyone having ever seen it before are astronomically low.\nThat example still doesn't do it justice. The number of possible private keys is close to the number of atoms in the known universe. In a nutshell, this is a vital security principle in crypto networks like \nWe won't get into depth on how this is done in this article. All you need to know is that, while it's easy to generate a public address with the private key, doing the reverse is impossible today. That's why you can safely list your public address on blogs, social media, etc. No one can spend the funds sent to it without the corresponding private key.\nYou should note that wallets today rarely have just one private key – they're hierarchical deterministic (HD) wallets, meaning they can hold billions of different keys. All you need to know is a \nUnless you deliberately choose to use only one private key, you'll probably be asked to back up a seed phrase when you create a new wallet. When we discuss key storage later, the term keys will be used interchangeably to describe both private keys and seeds.\nYour 12, 18, or 24-word seed phrase is extremely important to keep secure and safe. Anyone who has access to the phrase can import your keys into their wallet and steal your funds. You may also have a JSON file or individual private keys that act the same as a seed phrase. Think extremely carefully about how you manage your keys by following our tips below.\nYou could store the phrase physically or on an offline device. Even if you have a cold storage device that we'll discuss later, you should also backup the key if your device breaks.\nWriting the words on a piece of paper that can be destroyed or easily lost at home isn't a good idea. You might want to use a safety deposit box in a secure location or store the phrase with your bank. Some people will even engrave their seed phrase onto metal as it can't be easily destroyed or use metal letters on a seed board.\nWallets fall into two categories: hot wallets and cold wallets. Both differ in the security that they offer. The two types encompass a broad range of different solutions – check out \nA hot wallet is any cryptocurrency wallet that connects to the Internet (e.g., smartphone and desktop wallets). Hot wallets tend to provide the most seamless user experience. They're convenient when it comes to sending, receiving, or trading cryptocurrencies and tokens. But this convenience often comes at the cost of security.\nHot wallets are inherently vulnerable because of their Internet connectivity. Though private keys aren't broadcast at any point, there's a possibility that your online device can be infected and remotely accessed by malicious actors.\nThis isn't to say that hot wallets are completely insecure – they're just less secure than cold wallets. Hot wallets are superior on the usability front and thus are the generally preferred option for holding smaller balances.\nTo eliminate the significant online attack vector, many opt instead to keep their keys offline at all times. They do so with cold wallets. Unlike hot wallets, cold wallets don't connect to the Internet. Previously, some cryptocurrency holders would keep a paper wallet: a printed piece of paper containing the wallet's private key, usually in the form of a QR code. However, we now see this as an outdated, risky security method. Your best option for cold storage is definitely a hardware wallet.\n) aim to provide a better user experience while adopting a similar principle of keeping the private key offline. These are more portable, cheaper than a full PC, and custom-made for cryptocurrency storage.\nThe physical devices store your private keys securely and never need to connect to the Internet. A good hardware wallet ensures that private keys never leave the device. They're usually held in a special place in the device that doesn't allow them to be removed. See \n, then, at the protocol level, you're not really in possession of your coins. Instead, the exchange holds your funds and keys in custody and manages them on your behalf (hence the term custodial wallet). In most cases, the exchange uses a combination of hot and cold wallets to keep your coins safe.\nfor BTC, the exchange reduces your BNB balance and increases your BTC one in its database. But there is no blockchain transaction involved. When you decide to withdraw that BTC, you request that the exchange sign a transaction on your behalf. They will then broadcast a transaction that sends your coins to the Bitcoin address you provide.\nCrypto exchanges provide a much more convenient experience for users that aren't concerned with third-party custody of their funds. One of the risks of being your own bank is that no one can come to your rescue if something goes wrong.\nIf you lose your private key, you'll never recover your funds. If you lose your account password, on the other hand, you just need to reset it. You're still at risk of having your credentials stolen, so you need to ensure that you're taking the suitable precautions we mentioned above to secure your account.\nUnfortunately, there's not a single answer to that question – this would be a much shorter article if there was. The answer largely depends on your risk profile and how you use your cryptocurrency.\nare the most straightforward options – but make sure you test them out with small amounts to get comfortable first. You'll also want to keep your keys backed up elsewhere as per our tips above in case the device itself is lost or fails.\nOnline wallets are great for small amounts that you're using to buy goods and services. If your cold storage is like a savings account, your mobile wallet is like the physical wallet you carry around. Ideally, it should be an amount that, if lost, would not cause you serious financial issues.\n, and trading, custodial solutions are your best bet. Before putting your funds to use, though, you should come up with a plan for how much you're allocating (e.g., with a \nUnless you've studied the smart contract yourself and understand exactly what it does, there's always a chance of a backdoor exploit. Typically, projects go through auditing to prove that their smart contracts are safe. Certik is a famous provider of audits, but this reputation still doesn't always guarantee safety.\nA compromised project will ask for permission to move unlimited or large amounts of tokens. Less experienced users are more likely to accept these and become victims of fraud. Even if you remove your funds from the DeFi platform, the project may still have some control and be able to steal them. Hackers can also attempt to manipulate and abuse smart contracts. Once again, if you've given permission to a project, you could be at risk in this situation.\nYou'll now see a list of smart contracts that have permissions in your account and how much they are approved for. To revoke the permission, click the button circled in red below.\nAs we mentioned above, audited projects are more secure options to invest your tokens and coins with. If you're interacting with smart contracts, staking in pools, or providing liquidity, it's recommended you always look for projects with audits.\nAn audit analyses a DApp's smart contract code. The auditors will look for backdoors, exploitable scripts, and security issues. These are reported to the project founders, who then make changes to the code. Any changes are added to the final report to show users the complete, transparent process. The final report can then be made public.\nWhile an audit cannot guarantee a project's safety, the chance of your funds being more secure does improve. It would be unwise to invest money in a project that has no audit available. Some smart contracts handle a massive amount of funds which makes them attractive to hackers. If auditors don't check the code, they become easy targets.\nCryptocurrencies, unfortunately, attract many scammers. People look to exploit other users and take their crypto, and once the funds are stolen, there is usually no way of getting them back. Scammers abuse the anonymous nature of cryptocurrencies and the fact that many users directly control large amounts of funds. \nYou should always be vigilant and never send money to users you don’t know. You should also always check the identity carefully of anyone you do send money to. Here are some of the most common scams to look out for:\n- You may receive an email from an exchange or other service you use, asking you to log in or provide personal information. However, this may be a scammer looking to steal your information.\n- These are often mobile apps or websites which imitate the look of an exchange. Once you enter your details, a scammer will then use it to access your real account.\n- A scammer may send you malware that holds your files for ransom. To pay, you will most likely have to send Bitcoin or another currency to get them back. You may not even receive the files after payment.\n- You may be offered to participate in a new project and purchase its coins or enter a special deal requiring you to make a crypto payment. However, a deal that’s too good to be true often is. Do your own research to make sure what you’re investing in is safe.\n- Someone may pretend to be an official, person of trust, or even friend. They will then ask you for crypto or information that you would not typically give out. In this case, always double-check someone is who they say they are.\nWhen it comes to keeping your cryptocurrencies secure, the blockchain industry today provides many security measures. From trading through to storing and using your crypto, simple tips are effective in keeping your funds safe. In terms of storage, each alternative has its benefits and drawbacks, so it's essential to understand the trade-offs. As always, make sure to do proper research into anywhere you’re putting your money or crypto.\n",

As a result, a wave of scams (both decades-old classics and cryptocurrency-specific swindles) has flooded the digital realm. \nIt’s amazing, nowadays, how everyone seems so generous on the likes of Twitter and Facebook. Check the replies to a tweet with high engagement, and you’ll no doubt see that one of your favorite crypto companies or influencers is doing a giveaway. If you send them just 1 BNB/BTC/ETH, they promise to send you back 10x that amount! It seems too good to be true, doesn’t it? Unfortunately, that’s because it is. That’s a pretty good rule of thumb to apply to many of these scams.\nIt’s incredibly unlikely that someone is hosting a legitimate giveaway that requires you to first send your own money. On social media, you should be wary of these kinds of messages. They might come from accounts that might look identical to the ones you know and love, but this is part of the trick. As for the dozens of replies thanking said account for their generosity – they’re just fake accounts or bots deployed as part of the giveaway scam.\nSuffice it to say, you should just ignore these. If you’re really convinced they are legit, take a closer look at the profiles and you’ll see the differences. You will soon realize that the Twitter handle or the Facebook profile are fake.\nPyramid and Ponzi schemes are slightly different, but we’re placing them into the same category because of their similarities. In both cases, the scam relies on a participant bringing new members with the promise of incredible returns.\nIn a Ponzi scheme, you might hear about an investment opportunity with guaranteed profits (this is your first red flag!). Commonly, you’ll see this scheme disguised as a portfolio management service. In reality, there’s no magical formula at work here – the “returns” received are just other investors’ money.\nThe organizer will take an investor’s money and add it to a pool. The only inflow of cash into the pool comes from new entrants. Older investors are paid off with newer investors’ money, a cycle that can continue as more newcomers join. The scam unravels when there isn’t any more cash coming in – unable to sustain payouts to older investors, the scheme collapses.\nConsider, for instance, a service that promises 10% returns in a month. You could contribute $100. The organizer then ropes in another ‘client’, who also invests $100. Using this newly-acquired money, he can pay you $110 at the end of the month. He would then need to entice yet another client to join, in order to pay the second one. The cycle continues until the inevitable implosion of the scheme.\nIn a pyramid scheme, there’s a bit more work required by those involved. At the top of the pyramid is the organizer. They’ll recruit a certain number of people to work on the level beneath them, and each of those people will recruit their own number of people, etc. As a result, you end up with a massive structure that grows exponentially and ramifies as new levels are created (hence the term Pyramid).\nSo far, we’ve only described what could be a chart for a very large (legitimate) business. But a pyramid scheme is distinct in the way it promises revenue for recruiting new members. Take an example where the organizer gives Alice and Bob the right to enlist new members for $100 each, and takes a 50% cut on their subsequent revenue. Alice and Bob can offer the same deal to those they recruit (they’ll need at least two recruits to recover their initial investment).\nFor instance, if Alice sells memberships to both Carol and Dan (at $100 each), she’ll be left with $100 because half of her revenue must be passed onto the level above her. If Carol goes on to sell memberships, then we’ll see rewards trickle upwards – Alice gets half of Carol’s revenue, and the organizer gets half of Alice’s half.\nAs the pyramid scheme grows, the older members earn an increasing stream of revenue as the distribution costs are passed from the lower to the upper levels. But because of the exponential growth, the model is not sustainable for long.\nSometimes, participants are paying for the rights to sell a product or service. You might have heard of certain multi-level marketing (MLM) companies accused of running pyramid schemes in this manner.\nIt’s easy to overlook the warning signs on fake apps if you’re not careful. Typically, these scams will direct users to download malicious applications – some of which mimic popular ones.\nOnce the user installs a malicious app, everything might seem to work as intended. However, these apps are specifically designed to steal your cryptocurrencies. In the crypto space, there were many cases where users downloaded malicious apps whose developers masqueraded as a major crypto company. \nIn such a scenario, when the user is presented with an address to fund the wallet or to receive payments, they’re actually sending funds to an address owned by the fraudster. Of course, once the funds are transferred, there’s no undo button. \nAnother thing that makes these scams particularly effective is their ranking position. Despite being malicious apps, some can rank highly in the Apple Store or Google Play Store, giving them an air of legitimacy. To avoid falling for them, you should only download from the official website or from a link given by a trusted source. You might also want to check the publisher’s credentials when using Apple Store or Google Play Store.\n. It typically involves the scammer impersonating a person or company to extract personal data from victims. It can take place across many mediums – telephone, email, fake websites or messaging apps. Messaging apps scams are particularly common in the cryptocurrency environment.\nThere’s no single playbook that scammers adhere to when trying to get ahold of personal information. You may get emails notifying you of something wrong with your exchange account, which requires you to follow a link to fix the problem. That link will redirect to a fake website – similar to the original one – that will prompt you to log in. This way, the attacker will steal your credentials, and possibly your cryptocurrencies.\nA common Telegram scam sees the scammer lurking in official groups for crypto wallets or exchanges. When a user reports a problem in this group, the scammer will reach out to the user privately, impersonating customer support or team members. From there, they’ll urge the user to share their personal information and \nIf someone learns your seed words, they’ll have access to your funds. Under no circumstances should they be revealed to anyone, not even legitimate companies. Troubleshooting issues with wallets does not require knowledge of your seed, so it’s safe to assume that anyone asking for it is a scammer.\nWith regards to exchange accounts, Binance will never ask for your password, either. The same is true of most other services. The most prudent course of action if you receive an unsolicited communication is not to engage, but rather to reach out to the company via the contact details listed on their official site.\n\n\nWhen it comes to investing, you should never take someone’s word for granted on what cryptocurrencies or tokens to purchase. You never know their true motives. They may be paid to promote a particular  or have a large investment of their own. This goes for random strangers all the way to popular influencers and personalities. No project is guaranteed to succeed. In fact, many will fail.\nTo be able to assess a project objectively, you should be looking at a combination of factors. Everyone has their own approach to researching prospective investments. Here are some general questions to get started:\n\n\nMalicious actors have no shortage of techniques for siphoning funds from unsuspecting cryptocurrency users. To steer clear of the most common scams, you need to remain constantly vigilant and aware of the schemes used by these parties. Always check that you’re using official websites/applications, and remember: if an investment sounds too good to be true, it probably is.\n",

      "title": "What Is Decentralized Finance (DeFi)?",
      "markdown": "  * While Ethereum was DeFi's original home, most blockchains with smart contract capabilities now host DeFi DApps, including layer-2 solutions like Arbitrum and Optimism. Smart contracts are essential to the services DeFi offers, which include staking, investing, lending, harvesting, and more.\n  * DeFi allows people to optimize yield, join decentralized marketplaces, access banking services, and engage in quick borrowing and lending. However, DeFi isn't without its risks; you should always do careful research before taking risks.\n\n\nEntering the world of decentralized finance (DeFi) can be exciting but also confusing. After some time HODLing, it's common to wonder how you can squeeze extra gains out of your portfolio. However, there's a lot to unpack when it comes to DeFi.\nWhen used responsibly, DeFi DApps and projects can become powerful tools. But if you jump in too soon, it's easy to become overwhelmed and make unwise investment decisions. The best way to get involved is to learn the risks and find what's suitable for you. With this in mind, let's explore the basics you'll need when starting your DeFi journey.\nnetworks. More specifically, DeFi aims to create an open-source, permissionless, and transparent financial service ecosystem that is available to everyone and operates without any central authority. Users maintain complete control over their assets and interact with this ecosystem through peer-to-peer (\nTraditional finance relies on institutions such as banks to act as intermediaries and courts to provide arbitration. DeFi applications don’t need any intermediaries or arbitrators. The code specifies the resolution of every possible dispute, and users maintain control over their funds at all times. This automation reduces costs and allows for a more frictionless financial system.\nAnother significant advantage of such an open ecosystem is the ease of access for individuals who otherwise wouldn't have access to any financial services. Since the traditional financial system relies on intermediaries making a profit, their services are typically absent from low-income communities. However, with DeFi, costs are significantly reduced, and low-income individuals can also benefit from a broader range of financial services.\nprotocols are among the most popular application types in the DeFi ecosystem. Open, decentralized borrowing and lending have many advantages over the traditional credit system, including instant transaction settlement, no credit checks, and the ability to collateralize digital assets.\nSince these lending services are built on public blockchains, they minimize trust requirements and provide cryptographic verification. Lending marketplaces on the blockchain reduce counterparty risk and make borrowing and lending cheaper, faster, and available to more people.\nAs the blockchain industry matures, there's an increased focus on creating stablecoins. These are crypto assets usually pegged to real-world assets and are easily digitally transferable. As cryptocurrency prices can fluctuate rapidly, decentralized stablecoins could be adopted for everyday use as digital currencies not issued or monitored by a central authority.\n, underwriting and legal fees for mortgages could be reduced significantly. Insurance on the blockchain could eliminate intermediaries and allow the distribution of risk between many participants, potentially resulting in lower premiums with the same quality of service.\nBlockchain technology may also be used to issue and allow ownership of a wide range of conventional financial instruments. These applications would work in a decentralized way that cuts out custodians and eliminates single points of failure.\nmining, delegating BNB, or providing liquidity. A smart contract can take your rewards, purchase more of the underlying asset, and reinvest it. This process will compound your interest, often significantly raising your returns.\nUsing a smart contract saves time and optimizes compounding. Your funds are usually pooled with other users’, meaning gas fees are shared across all members of the yield-optimizing smart contract.\nMost existing and potential applications of decentralized finance involve creating and executing smart contracts. While a usual contract uses legal terminology to specify the terms of the relationship between the entities entering the contract, a smart contract uses computer code.\nSince their terms are written in computer code, smart contracts can enforce those terms in an automated manner. This enables reliable execution and automation of many business processes that currently require manual supervision.\nUsing smart contracts is faster, easier, and reduces the risk for both parties. However, smart contracts also introduce new types of risks. As computer code is prone to bugs and vulnerabilities, the value and confidential information locked in smart contracts are at risk.\nBlockchains are inherently slower than their centralized counterparts, affecting the applications built on them. Developers of DeFi applications need to take these limitations into account and optimize their products accordingly. Layer-2 solutions like Arbitrum and Optimism are addressing these issues by offering faster and cheaper transactions.\nDeFi applications transfer the responsibility from intermediaries to the user. This can be a negative aspect for many. Designing products that minimize the risk of user error is a tough challenge when the products are deployed on top of immutable blockchains.\nUsing DeFi applications currently requires extra effort on the user's part. For DeFi applications to become a core element of the global financial system, they must provide a tangible benefit that incentivizes users to switch from the traditional system. Recent improvements in user interfaces and educational resources are helping to mitigate this issue.\nFinding the most suitable application for a specific use case can be daunting, and users must be able to find the best choices. The challenge is not only building the applications but also thinking about how they fit into the broader DeFi ecosystem. \nWhile the DeFi world can offer appealing APYs, it is not without risks. Even though they are decentralized, you are essentially consuming financial services, and some of the risks are familiar:\nThe legality of certain services and projects can be difficult to ascertain. If you are invested in a smart contract that is subsequently shut down due to regulatory problems, then your funds can be at risk. Recent actions and guidelines from global regulators are influencing the development and adoption of DeFi.\nThe assets you hold have different risk levels affected by their liquidity, trustworthiness, token smart contract security, and associated project and team. As the DeFi space has many low market-cap tokens, token risk can be particularly high.\nCode vulnerabilities can undermine the security of smart contracts you’re invested in. Your wallet could also be compromised due to connecting to DeFi DApps and giving them certain permissions. Security practices, such as multi-signature wallets and insurance funds, are emerging to address these risks.\nFinding projects and DeFi protocols requires research. Online forums, messengers, and websites can help you learn about new opportunities. However, be extremely cautious with any information you find. Always double-check the safety of any project you read or hear about.\n  * or a mobile one such as Trust Wallet will do the job. A custodial wallet (one where you don't own the private keys) is less likely to allow you to connect to DApps.\n  * \n\nDeFi offers an open financial system to anyone with internet access, contrasting traditional finance, which relies on centralized institutions and regulatory bodies. However, DeFi and traditional finance are increasingly interacting. Banks and financial institutions are beginning to explore DeFi protocols, creating hybrid models that blend the benefits of both systems.\nEven in the crypto world, not every financial service is decentralized. For example, staking through a centralized exchange like Binance often requires you to give up custody of your tokens. In this case, you must trust the centralized entity that deals with your funds.\nThe majority of the services offered will be the same. They likely are done through the same DeFi platforms that a user can access directly. However, CeFi takes away the often complicated nature of managing DeFi investments yourself. You may also have extra guarantees on your deposits.\nCeFi is neither worse nor better than DeFi. Its suitability depends on your wants and needs. While you may sacrifice some control in CeFi, you often receive stronger guarantees and offload some responsibility for handling assets and executing transactions.\nOpen banking is a banking system where third-party financial service providers are given secure access to financial data through APIs. This enables the networking of accounts and data between banks and non-bank financial institutions. Essentially, it allows for new products and services within the traditional financial system. \nDeFi has quickly created a self-sustaining ecosystem of value that attracts capital, developers, and new products. While DeFi promises to revolutionize the financial sector, it is still an emerging field. The future of DeFi lies in ongoing technological advancements, regulatory developments, and increasing mainstream adoption. For sustainable growth, continuous innovation is essential to address the limitations and risks associated with DeFi.\n_Disclaimer: This content is presented to you on an “as is” basis for general information and educational purposes only, without representation or warranty of any kind.

      "title": "What Is An NFT?",
      "markdown": "  * NFTs are stored on the blockchain, which means they can't be easily edited, copied or duplicated. There, they can act as a publicly verifiable proof of ownership on a decentralized database.\n\n\nThe term “non-fungible” refers to the irreplaceable nature of an item. A non-fungible item cannot be directly exchanged for another item of the same value because both items have different characteristics. This means non-fungible items cannot be traded on a standardized scale as their value is derived from their uniqueness and the subjective value that buyers place on them.\nFungible assets such as currency are easily exchanged because of their uniformity. In contrast, non-fungible assets are distinct and irreplaceable, which can appeal to collectors who want to acquire something truly unique.\nAn NFT is a cryptographic token hosted on a blockchain and it can be used to represent a digital asset. The non-fungibility of NFTs defines them as digital assets that represent ownership of one-of-a-kind items such as artwork, video game items, trading cards, virtual real estate, and other digital goods.\n, which provides a decentralized ledger that records transactions and ownership details. Its transparent and immutable nature allows the ownership history of an NFT to be clearly traced. This verifies the authenticity and legitimacy of the NFT as it changes hands over time.\nA critical aspect of NFTs is the implementation of token standards. They ensure interoperability and consistency across different platforms by defining rules and functions for creating, managing, and transferring NFTs. For example, the most widely adopted token standards for NFTs are \nThe NFT creation process is typically referred to as minting. Using smart contracts, minting converts digital files into digital assets on a blockchain. When purchasing an NFT, you essentially acquire ownership of the unique identifier (or token ID) associated with that specific digital asset. As a result, the code owner possesses the exclusive rights to use, display, and interact with that asset.\nNFT art offers artists a new way to monetize their work. By tokenizing their art, creators can sell unique digital copies, preserving the originality and scarcity of each piece. NFT art also allows collectors to showcase their pieces in virtual galleries, trade them, or even lend them to others.\nNFT games incorporate NFTs as digital collectibles, such as in-game items and characters. NFTs can also represent virtual real estate that players can trade. This has the potential to create a gaming ecosystem where players can monetize their in-game achievements and assets and create a secondary market.\nNFT staking allows users to earn rewards by staking their NFTs as collateral. This can already be done on certain decentralized finance (DeFi) platforms, enabling NFT holders to earn interest while retaining ownership of their NFTs.\nNFTs can be useful for ticket management. For example, event organizers can issue NFTs as tickets that provide immutable proof of ownership and attendance. In addition, NFT tickets can be transferred and resold without involving third parties. NFT tickets can also come with exclusive benefits, such as access to VIP areas, exclusive merchandise, or special digital content.\nis one of the earliest and most iconic NFT projects. It was launched in 2017 and consists of 10,000 unique, algorithmically generated 8-bit pixel art characters. Each CryptoPunk character has different traits and attributes, which makes them attractive to collectors.\nYou may have even seen celebrities using these characters as their social media avatars. The success of the project has set the stage for a new era of digital art and collectibles.\nis a collection of 10,000 unique, hand-drawn cartoon ape characters, each with varying features. These digital artworks serve as collectibles and give their owners access to exclusive events and virtual spaces. As such, these NFTs blur the lines between digital art and experiential offerings.\nis a virtual reality (VR) platform built on the Ethereum blockchain. It features a decentralized marketplace for NFTs that allows users to trade virtual plots of land and various in-game items. Decentraland is at the forefront of virtual real estate and the metaverse.\nAs we have learned, NFTs inherit the security features of their underlying blockchains. However, there is still the risk of fraud and scams attached to them. This can include phishing attempts or hackers exploiting smart contract vulnerabilities. There is also the possibility of counterfeit NFTs and unauthorized reproductions of copyrighted material. \nAnother aspect to consider is the long-term value of NFTs. While some NFTs have attained astronomical prices, the market can be volatile and speculative. As with any investment, long-term stability is not guaranteed.\nAt the same time, an NFT’s security can be influenced by the blockchain on which it is minted. As some blockchains may have better developed ecosystems and more robust security than others, NFT security tends to vary.\nare digital assets that use blockchain technology, they have different purposes and characteristics. Cryptocurrencies are often designed to facilitate transactions. They are also fungible, meaning each unit is exchangeable for another unit of the same currency. For example, you can exchange one bitcoin for another without there being any difference in value.\nNFTs, on the other hand, are unique digital assets. They are non-fungible, meaning each has unique characteristics and cannot be directly exchanged for another NFT on a one-to-one basis. In short, NFTs derive their value from their uniqueness and scarcity.\nNFTs are unique blockchain-based digital assets that establish the ownership and verify the authenticity of the items they represent. They have gained popularity in the form of a variety of applications, offering creators new ways to monetize their work and collectors the opportunity to own and display unique assets.\nHowever, NFTs also come with potential risks, such as fraud and market volatility. Although they share some similarities with cryptocurrencies, NFTs are distinguished by their non-fungible nature, which allows them to offer unique digital opportunities.\n\n\n_This content is presented to you on an “as is” basis for general information and educational purposes only, without representation or warranty of any kind.

      "markdown": "  * AMMs, such as Uniswap, replace traditional order books with liquidity pools. This system allows users to trade instantly without the need to match buyers and sellers, making decentralized trading more efficient and accessible.\n  * Decentralized exchanges can be a bit trickier to get the hang of, especially for beginners. You need to manage your own wallet, keep your seed phrase safe, and understand how gas fees and blockchains work.\n\n\nFrom the early days of Bitcoin, exchanges have played a vital role in matching cryptocurrency buyers with sellers. Without these forums attracting a global user base, we’d have much poorer liquidity and no way to agree on the price of assets.\nWhen you use a centralized exchange, you're trusting the company to handle your crypto, much like a bank does with your money. With DEXs, no one’s holding your assets for you. Instead, you’re interacting directly with other traders through the \n. When you deposit crypto, you give up control of it. Not from a usability standpoint, as you can still trade it, but from a technical standpoint. You have to withdraw your funds if you want to use it somewhere else.\nThe general workflow is incredibly streamlined on a CEX because the trades don’t have to rely on blockchain confirmations, and everything occurs in a single entity’s system. Cryptocurrencies are easier to buy and sell, and you have more products and tools available to you.\nThis does come at the cost of independence: you need to trust the exchange with your money. As a result, you expose yourself to some counterparty risk. What if the team runs off with your hard-earned BTC? What if a hacker cripples the system and drains the funds?\nDEXs are similar to their centralized counterparts in some ways but significantly different in others. Let’s first note that there are a few different types of decentralized exchanges available to users. The common theme among them is that orders are executed on-chain (with smart contracts) and that users do not sacrifice \nis done on-chain (we’ll talk about hybridized approaches shortly). Every order (as well as alteration and cancellation) is written to the blockchain. This is arguably the most transparent approach, as you’re not trusting a third party to relay the orders to you, and there’s no way to obfuscate them. \non the network to record the order forever, you end up paying a fee. You need to wait until a miner adds your message to the blockchain, meaning the experience can be cumbersome, too.\nbut have since been replaced by other alternatives. They could still be considered decentralized in some regards, but instead of every order being posted to the blockchain, they were hosted somewhere else.\n, which made them “less decentralized” than the other types of DEXs. This model also introduced some risks. If the entity in charge was malicious, they could game the markets to an extent (i.e., by frontrunning or misrepresenting orders).\n. These pools are created when users deposit their crypto into a shared pool, and trades are made based on a formula that sets the price. The advantage? You can trade at any time without waiting for a buyer or seller to match your order.\n\n\n\n  * : DEXs rely on smart contracts, which are only as good as the code they’re written on. If there’s a bug or a flaw, it can be exploited by hackers, potentially leading to significant losses.\n  *   *   * : On a DEX, when you submit a trade, others can see it before it’s processed. If someone with faster transaction fees jumps ahead of you, they can snatch up your trade at a better price.\n\n\nAnother exciting area is cross-chain trading, which allows users to trade assets across different blockchains. While this is still in its early days, it’s a game-changer for making DEXs more versatile and user-friendly.\nDEXs are changing the way we think about trading crypto. By cutting out the middleman, giving users control of their assets, and opening up global access to financial services, they offer a compelling alternative to centralized exchanges. \nWhile there are still challenges to overcome, the future looks bright. As more users adopt decentralized finance, DEXs will likely play a bigger role in how we trade and manage our digital assets.\n_Disclaimer: This content is presented to you on an “as is” basis for general information and educational purposes only, without representation or warranty of any kind.

      "title": "What Is Web3 and Why Does It Matter?",
      "markdown": "The Internet is a constantly evolving technology that continues to innovate. So far, we’ve experienced Web 1.0 and 2.0, and there’s much discussion of what to expect from Web3. Web 1.0 provided a static experience for users without the ability to create the content-rich sites we have today. Web 2.0 brought us together with social media and dynamic websites, but at the cost of centralization.\nWeb3 looks to give us control of our online information and also create a semantic web. This means that machines will easily read and process user-generated content. Blockchain will provide the power for decentralization, free digital identities with crypto wallets, and open digital economies.\nThe ways we interact with the net will become more immersive with 3D options available. The benefits to the user also include efficient browsing, relevant advertising, and improved customer support. Some of the most widely used Web3 technology can be seen with virtual assistants like Siri and Alexa and connected smart homes.\nOver the past twenty or so years, the Internet has changed dramatically. We've gone from Internet Relay Chat (IRC) to modern social media platforms. Basic digital payments to sophisticated online banking services. We've even experienced brand new, Internet-based technologies like crypto and blockchain. The Internet has become a vital part of human interactions and connectivity - and continues to evolve. So far, we've seen Web 1.0 and 2.0, but what exactly should we expect from Web3? Let's dive into the details and see what's in store for us.\n(AI), and blockchain technology. The term was created by Gavin Wood, Polkadot's founder and the co-founder of Ethereum. While Web 2.0 focuses on user-created content hosted on centralized websites, Web3 will give users more control of their online data. \nThe movement aims to create open, connected, intelligent websites and web apps with an improved machine-based understanding of data. Decentralization and digital economies also play an important role in Web3, as they allow us to place value on the content created on the net. It's also important to understand that Web3 is a changing concept. There is no single definition, and its exact meaning can differ from person to person.\nand development in Big Data analytics will mean that machines can intuitively understand and recommend content. Web3 will also focus on user-ownership of content and support for accessible digital economies.\nCurrent websites typically display static information or user-driven content, like forums or social media. While this allows data to be published to the masses, it doesn't cater to specific users' needs. A website should tailor the information it provides to each user, similar to the dynamism of real-world human communication. With Web 2.0, once this information is online, users lose ownership and control.\n> _I have a dream for the Web [in which computers] become capable of analyzing all the data on the Web – the content, links, and transactions between people and computers. A \"Semantic Web,\" which makes this possible, has yet to emerge, but when it does, the day-to-day mechanisms of trade, bureaucracy, and our daily lives will be handled by machines talking to machines._\nBerners-Lee's vision has since combined with Gavin Wood's message. Here, an ocean of decentralized information will be available to websites and applications. They will understand and use that data meaningfully with individual users. \nThe original Internet provided an experience now known as Web 1.0. The term was coined in 1999 by author and web designer Darci DiNucci when distinguishing between Web 1.0 and Web 2.0. In the early 1990s, websites were built using static HTML pages that could only display information. There was no way for users to change the data or upload their own. Social interactions were limited to simple chat messengers and forums.\nDuring the late 1990s, a shift towards a more interactive Internet started taking form. With Web 2.0, users were able to interact with websites through databases, server-side processing, forms, and social media. These tools changed the web experience from a static to a dynamic one. \nbetween different sites and applications. Web 2.0 was less about observation and more about participation. By the mid-2000s, most websites transitioned to Web 2.0, and big tech began building up social networks and cloud-based services.\nmakes sense when looking at the Internet's history. Data was first statically presented to users. Then users could interact with that data dynamically. Now, algorithms will use all that data to improve user experience and make the web more personalized and familiar. You only need to look at YouTube or Netflix to see the power of algorithms and how they have already improved.\n, and more. Web3 also aims to make the Internet more open and decentralized. In the current framework, users rely on network and cellular providers that access their personal data and information. With the advent of distributed ledger technologies, that soon might change, and users could take back ownership of their data.\nWeb3 is still far from complete adoption, but its core concepts are mostly already defined. The four topics below are commonly listed as the most important aspects of the Web3 future.\nOver time, machines have improved at understanding the data and content humans create. However, there is still a long way to create a seamless experience where semantics are fully understood. For example, the use of the word \"bad\" can, in some cases, mean 'good'. For a machine to understand this can be incredibly hard. However, with Big Data and more information to study, AI is beginning to understand better what we write on the web and present it intuitively.\nData ownership, online economies, and decentralization are essential aspects of Gavin Wood's Web3 future. We'll cover the topic in more detail later on, but blockchain provides a tried and tested system to reach many of these goals. The power for anyone to tokenize assets, put information on-chain, and create a digital identity is a huge innovation that lends itself to Web3.\nPut simply, the way the web looks will change hugely. We're already seeing a move towards 3D environments that even incorporate virtual reality. The metaverse is one area pioneering these experiences, and we're already familiar with socializing through 3D video games. The fields of UI and UX also work towards presenting information in more intuitive ways for web users.\nArtificial intelligence is the key to turning human-created content into machine-readable data. We're already familiar with customer service bots, but this is just the beginning. AI can both present data to us and sort it, making it a versatile tool for Web3. Best of all, AI will learn and improve itself, reducing the work needed for human development in the future.\n- Since intermediaries are removed from the equation, they will no longer control user data. This freedom reduces the risk of censorship by governments or corporations and cuts down the effectiveness of \n- As more products become connected to the Internet, larger data sets provide algorithms with more information to analyze. This can help them deliver more accurate information that accommodates the individual user's specific needs.\n- When using search engines, finding the best results have sometimes posed a challenge. However, they have become better at finding semantically-relevant results based on search context and metadata over the years. This results in a more convenient web browsing experience that can help anyone find the exact information they need with ease.\n- No one likes being bombarded with online ads. However, if the ads are relevant to your needs, they could be useful instead of being an annoyance. Web3 aims to improve advertising by leveraging smarter AI systems and targeting specific audiences based on consumer data.\n- Customer service is critical for a smooth user experience for websites and web applications. Due to the massive costs, though, many web services that become successful struggle to scale their customer service operations. Using more intelligent chatbots that can talk to multiple customers simultaneously, users can enjoy a superior experience when dealing with support agents.\nBlockchain and crypto have great potential when it comes to Web3. Decentralized networks successfully create incentives for more responsible data ownership, governance, and content creation. Some of its most relevant aspects for Web3 include:\n- Anyone can create a wallet that allows you to make transactions and acts as a digital identity. There's no need to store your details or create an account with a centralized service provider. You have total control over your wallet, and often the same wallet can be used across multiple blockchains.\n- The transparent spread of information and power across a vast collection of people is simple with blockchain. This is in contrast to Web 2.0, where large tech giants dominate huge areas of our online lives.\n- The ability to own data on a blockchain and use decentralized transactions creates new digital economies. These allow us to easily value and trade online goods, services, and content without the need for banking or personal details. This openness helps improve access to financial services and empowers users to begin earning.\nBoth Apple’s Siri and Amazon’s Alexa offer virtual assistants that check many of the Web3 boxes. AI and natural language processing help both services better understand human voice commands. The more people use Siri and Alexa, the more their AI improves its recommendations and interactions. This makes it a perfect example of a semantically intelligent web app that belongs in the Web3 world.\nOne key feature of Web3 is ubiquity. This means that we can access our data and online services across multiple devices. Systems that control your home’s heating, air conditioning, and other utilities can now do so in a smart and connected manner. Your smart home can tell when you leave, arrive, and how hot or cold you like your house. It can use this information, and more, to create a personalized experience. You can then access this service from your phone or other online devices, no matter where you are.\nThe evolution of the Internet has been a long journey and will surely continue towards further iterations. With the massive explosion of available data, websites and applications are transitioning to a more immersive web experience. While there is still no concrete definition for Web3, the innovations are already in motion. It’s plain to see the direction we are going, and blockchain, of course, looks to be a key part of the Web3 future.\n",

      "markdown": "\n\nStaking is the process of locking up a certain amount of cryptocurrency to help secure and support the operations of a blockchain network. By doing so, stakers are rewarded with additional cryptocurrency, making it a popular method for investors to earn passive income. Staking is an important part of \n, which is a resource-intensive process. Instead of having miners use computational power to solve complex math problems, PoS networks rely on validators selected based on the number of coins they hold and are willing to stake.\nIn short, staking involves locking up your cryptocurrency to participate in the activities of a blockchain network. The process may differ depending on the blockchain, but here's how it typically works:\n: In PoS blockchains, validators are chosen based on a combination of factors, including the number of coins staked, the length of time they’ve been staked, and sometimes random selection.\nDepending on your level of technical expertise and the amount of crypto you want to stake, there are different ways to do it. Some of the most common types of staking include:\n  *   * : Some cryptocurrency exchanges offer staking services, providing the easiest way to stake without handling the technicalities yourself. This method is also known as “staking as a service”. For example, you can earn daily rewards with \n  * \n\nA staking pool is a group of cryptocurrency holders who combine their staking power to increase their chances of being selected as validators. By pooling resources, participants can earn staking rewards proportionally to their contribution to the pool.\nThis option is especially beneficial for smaller investors who may not have enough coins to meet the minimum staking requirements. However, it’s essential to research and choose a reputable staking pool, as fees and security can vary.\nis a newer form of staking that allows users to stake their assets without losing liquidity. Unlike conventional staking, where assets are often locked and inaccessible during the staking period, liquid staking introduces mechanisms that enable users to maintain liquidity while still earning staking rewards.\n(LSTs), which are tokens that represent the staked assets. For instance, when you stake ETH on Binance, you will receive WBETH in return, which can be traded or used elsewhere without compromising the ETH staking rewards. Similarly, when you stake ETH on a platform like \nStaking is a way to make your idle assets work for you, meaning you can generate rewards while helping secure your favorite blockchain networks. Crypto staking is particularly common among long-term crypto holders who want to get the most out of their holdings.\n\n\nYes. It’s usually worth staking your idle crypto assets to generate passive income – especially if you are a long-term holder and want to support the project. However, the potential rewards and risks can vary depending on the cryptocurrency and platform of choice. \nFor example, if a DeFi staking platform offers great returns but fails to provide security, your staked assets could be stolen or lost. Market volatility is another risk factor that may offset rewards or cause losses.\nIf you become a PoS validator, you need to ensure your staking operations are working as intended. Validators who act maliciously or fail to maintain their node can be penalized, resulting in a loss of staked funds.\n: Some types of staking require locking up your coins for a specific period. Technical issues, like smart contract mistakes or software bugs, can result in loss of access or frozen funds.\nIf you stake through a third-party service, you are trusting others with your funds. If the platform gets hacked, your funds may be at risk. DeFi platforms may also involve similar risks, especially when you are required to grant full access to your crypto wallet.\nIn some blockchains, rewards are distributed as a fixed percentage, making it easier to predict your earnings. Staking rewards are often measured by their estimated annual returns, i.e., annual percentage rate (\nUsually, yes. You should be able to withdraw your staked crypto at any time. However, the exact mechanisms and rules will vary from one staking platform to another. In some cases, withdrawing staked assets early may lead to partial or total loss of the staking rewards.

The upgrade enables ETH stakers to opt in to automatically receive their staking rewards and withdraw their locked ETH at any time.\nStaking is specific to PoS blockchains. Cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, which operate on a PoW consensus mechanism, cannot be staked. Even within PoS networks, not all cryptocurrencies support staking, as they may use different mechanisms to incentivize participation.\nStaking cryptocurrency offers a way to participate in blockchain networks while earning rewards. Still, it’s crucial to understand the risks involved, including market volatility, third-party, slashing, and technical risks. By carefully choosing your staking method and thoroughly researching the network, you can effectively contribute to the blockchain ecosystem and potentially earn passive income.\n_Disclaimer: This content is presented to you on an “as is” basis for general information and educational purposes only, without representation or warranty of any kind.

      "markdown": "  * Miners collect pending transactions and organize them into blocks, which are then broadcast to the network. If the block is approved by the validating nodes, the miner receives the block reward.\n\n\nImagine a global digital ledger where every cryptocurrency transaction is recorded. Mining ensures this ledger stays accurate and secure. Miners use specialized computers to solve puzzles (essentially guessing numbers) to organize and confirm pending transactions. The first one to solve it gets rewarded with cryptocurrency.\nlike bitcoin (BTC). It's the process by which user transactions are verified and added to the blockchain's public ledger. Mining is one of the critical elements that allows the Bitcoin network to be decentralized, meaning it’s able to work without a central authority.\nMining operations are also responsible for adding new coins to the existing supply. While this may sound like printing money, crypto mining follows a set of hard-coded rules that govern the process and prevent anyone from arbitrarily creating new coins. These rules are built into the underlying protocols and enforced by the distributed network of nodes.\nTo create new cryptocurrency units, miners use their computing power to solve complex cryptographic puzzles. The first miner to solve the puzzle earns the right to add a new block of transactions to the \n). Validating nodes are responsible for verifying the validity of transactions. The job of a miner is to collect these pending transactions and organize them into blocks. Note that some miners also run validating nodes, but mining nodes and validating nodes are technically different.\nYou can think of a block as a page of the blockchain ledger in which several transactions are recorded (along with other data). More specifically, a mining node is responsible for collecting unconfirmed transactions from the memory pool and assembling them into a \nThe miner then attempts to convert this candidate block into a confirmed block. To do this, they must solve a complex math problem that requires a lot of computing resources. However, for each successfully mined block, the miner receives a \nIn the context of mining, the hash of each transaction consists of a string of numbers and letters that acts as an identifier. The transaction hash represents all the information contained in that transaction.\nIn addition to hashing and listing each transaction individually, the miner also adds a custom transaction, in which they send themselves the block reward. This transaction is called the coinbase transaction and is what creates brand-new coins. In most cases, this transaction is the first to be recorded in a new block, followed by a group of pending transactions awaiting confirmation.\nThe new hash outputs are then organized into pairs and hashed again, and the process is repeated until a single hash is created. This last hash is known as the root hash (or Merkle root) and is basically the hash that represents all the previous hashes used to generate it.\nA block header acts as an identifier for each individual block, meaning each block has a unique hash. When creating a new block, miners combine the hash of the previous block with the root hash of their candidate block to generate a new block hash. They must also add an arbitrary number known as a nonce.\nSo, when trying to confirm their candidate block, a miner needs to combine the root hash, the previous block’s hash, and a nonce and put them all through a hash function. Their goal is to do this repeatedly until they can create a valid hash.\nThe root hash and the hash of the previous block cannot be changed, so miners must change the nonce value several times until a valid hash is found. In order to be considered valid, the output (block hash) must be less than a certain target value determined by the protocol. In Bitcoin mining, the block hash must start with a certain number of zeros — this target value is known as the mining \nAs we’ve seen, miners must hash the block header repeatedly using different nonce values. They do so until they find a valid block hash. When a miner finds a valid block hash, they broadcast this block to the network. Then, all other validating nodes will check if the block is valid and, if so, add the new block to their copy of the blockchain.\nAt this point, the candidate block becomes a confirmed block, and all miners move on to mine the next block. Miners who couldn’t find a valid hash on time discard their candidate block as a new mining race starts.\nSometimes, two miners broadcast a valid block at the same time, and the network ends up with two competing blocks. The miners then start mining the next block based on the block they received first, causing the network to split into two different versions of the blockchain temporarily.\nThe competition between these blocks continues until the next block is mined on top of one of the competing blocks. When a new block is mined, whichever block came before it is considered the winner. The block that is then abandoned is called an \nThe mining difficulty is regularly adjusted by the protocol to ensure a constant rate for new block creation, leading to a steady and predictable issuance of new coins. The difficulty adjusts in proportion to the amount of computational power (\nEvery time new miners join the network and competition grows, the hashing difficulty increases, which prevents the average block time from decreasing. Conversely, if many miners leave the network, the hashing difficulty decreases, making it easier to mine a new block. These adjustments keep the average block time constant, regardless of the network’s total hashing power.\nThere are several ways to mine cryptocurrencies. Equipment and processes change as new hardware and consensus algorithms emerge. Typically, miners use specialized computing units to solve complicated cryptographic equations. Let’s take a look at some of the most common mining methods.\nHowever, as more people began to mine BTC and the network’s hash rate increased, profitable mining became increasingly difficult. The advent of specialized mining hardware with greater processing power eventually made CPU mining nearly impossible. Today, CPU mining is likely no longer a viable option, as most miners use specialized hardware.\nGraphics Processing Units (GPUs) are designed to process a wide range of applications simultaneously. While they're typically used for video games or graphics rendering, they can also be used for mining.\nGPUs are relatively inexpensive and more flexible than highly specialized mining hardware. GPUs can be used to mine some altcoins, but their efficiency depends on the mining difficulty and algorithm.\nis designed to serve a single specific purpose. In crypto, the term refers to specialized hardware designed exclusively for mining. ASIC mining is known for being highly efficient, but it’s relatively expensive. \nBecause ASIC miners are at the forefront of mining technology, the cost of a unit is much higher than that of a CPU or GPU. In addition, the constant advancement of ASIC technology can quickly render older ASIC models unprofitable. This makes ASIC mining one of the most expensive ways to mine, but it’s the most efficient and can be profitable if done on a large scale.\nSince each block reward is given only to the first successful miner, the probability of mining a block is extremely low. Miners with a small percentage of the mining power have a very small chance of discovering the next block on their own. \nMining pools are groups of miners who pool their resources (hash power) to increase their chances of winning block rewards. When the pool successfully finds a block, the miners in the pool share the reward according to the amount of work they each contributed.\nprovider. It’s a simpler way to start mining, but it comes with risks like scams or lower profitability. If you decide to try cloud mining, make sure to choose a reputable provider like \nand was introduced in the Bitcoin whitepaper in 2008. In a nutshell, PoW determines how a blockchain network reaches consensus across all distributed participants without third-party intermediaries. It does so by requiring significant investments in electricity and computing power to disincentivize bad actors.\nAs we’ve seen, pending transactions on a PoW network are ordered and added into blocks by miners who compete to solve puzzles using specialized mining hardware. The first miner to find a valid solution can broadcast their block to the blockchain, and, if the validating nodes accept their block, the miner receives the block reward.\nThe amount of crypto in a block reward varies from one blockchain to another. For example, on the Bitcoin blockchain, miners can get 3.125 BTC in block reward as of December 2024. Due to Bitcoin’s \nWhile it is possible to make money mining cryptocurrency, it requires careful consideration, risk management, and research. It also involves investments and risks, such as hardware costs, cryptocurrency price volatility, and cryptocurrency protocol changes. To mitigate these risks, miners often engage in risk management practices while assessing potential costs and benefits.\nThe profitability of crypto mining depends on several factors. One of them is changes in cryptocurrency prices. When cryptocurrency prices increase, the fiat value of mining rewards also increases. Conversely, profitability can decline along with decreasing prices.\nThe efficiency of the mining hardware is also a crucial factor in determining mining profitability. Mining hardware can be expensive, so miners must balance the cost of the hardware with the potential rewards it can generate. Another factor to consider is the cost of electricity; if it's too high, it could outweigh earnings and make mining unprofitable.\nIn addition, mining hardware may need to be upgraded relatively often, as they tend to become obsolete rather quickly. New models will outperform old ones, and if miners lack the budget to upgrade their machines, they will likely struggle to remain competitive.\nLast but not least, significant changes may happen at the protocol level. For example, the halving of Bitcoin can affect mining profitability as it cuts the reward for mining a block in half. In other cases, the process of mining can be replaced by other validation methods. For example, \nMining has certain advantages and disadvantages. The most obvious advantage is the potential income from block rewards. However, this is influenced by a number of factors, including electricity costs and market prices.

      "title": "Proof of Work (PoW) vs. Proof of Stake (PoS)",
      "markdown": "Proof of Work is used in Bitcoin to validate transactions and secure the network. Apart from other things, PoW prevents double-spending. The blockchain is secured by participants called miners, who use computational power to compete for the right to confirm new blocks and update the blockchain. A successful miner will be rewarded in BTC by the network. As of December 2021, a miner can get a block reward of 6.25 BTC plus transaction fees by successfully mining a Bitcoin block.\nThe major difference between PoW and PoS is the way they determine who gets to validate a block of transactions. Proof of Stake is the most popular alternative to Proof of Work. It’s a consensus mechanism that aims to improve on some of the limitations of PoW, such as scalability issues and energy consumption. In PoS, participants are called validators. They don’t need to use powerful hardware to compete for the chance to validate a block. Instead, they need to stake (lock) the native cryptocurrency of the blockchain. The network then selects a winner based on the amount of crypto staked, who will be rewarded a proportion of the transaction fees from the block they validate. The more coins staked, the higher the chance to be chosen as a validator.\nTo ensure that transactions recorded on a blockchain are valid, these networks adopt different consensus mechanisms. Proof of Work (PoW) is the oldest one. Created by Satoshi Nakamoto, it’s considered by many as one of the safest alternatives. Proof of Stake (PoS) was created later, but it’s now seen in most altcoin projects.\nApart from Bitcoin, PoW is also used in other major cryptocurrencies like Ethereum (ETH) and Litecoin (LTC). In contrast, PoS is used by Binance Coin (BNB), Solana (SOL), Cardano (ADA), and other altcoins. It’s worth noting that Ethereum plans to switch from PoW to PoS in 2022.\nProof of Work (PoW) is the consensus algorithm adopted by the Bitcoin network and many other cryptocurrencies to prevent . It was introduced by Satoshi Nakamoto in the Bitcoin whitepaper, published in 2008.\nOn a PoW network like the one of Bitcoin, transactions are verified by . They are participants that use a great amount of resources to ensure the network continues to run securely and correctly. Among other tasks, miners create and validate blocks of transactions. But in order to compete for the right to validate the next block, they need to use highly specialized mining hardware to solve complex mathematical puzzles. \nThe first miner that manages to find a valid solution for these math problems, earns the right to add their block to the blockchain and receive what we call a . Block rewards are made up of newly generated cryptocurrencies plus transaction fees. The amount of crypto in a block reward varies according to the different networks. For example, on the Bitcoin blockchain, a successful miner can get 6.25 BTC plus fees from each block reward (as of December 2021). However, the number of new BTCs generated per block is reduced by 50% every 210,000 blocks (approximately every four years) due to a mechanism known as .\nProof of Stake (PoS) is a introduced in 2011 as an alternative to Proof of Work. It aims to overcome the limitations of PoW networks. PoS is the second-most-popular algorithm adopted by cryptocurrencies like Binance Coin (BNB), Solana (SOL), and Cardano (ADA).\nWhile PoW and PoS share the same goal of reaching consensus in the blockchain, PoS has a different way of determining who validates a block of transactions. There are no miners on PoS blockchains. Rather than relying on powerful computers to compete for block validation rights, PoS validators rely on their crypto holdings.\nTo be eligible to validate a block, participants need to lock a certain amount of coins in a specific smart contract on the blockchain. This process is known as . The PoS protocol will then assign a participant to validate the next block. Depending on the network, this selection can be done randomly or according to their holdings (stake). The selected validator can receive transaction fees from the block they validated as rewards. Typically, the more coins they lock up, the higher the chance to be selected.\nDespite both being consensus mechanisms that ensure the security of the blockchain network, there are certain differences between the two. The major difference is, of course, how PoW and PoS determine which participant validates new transactions. For a clearer understanding, let’s take a look at the table below:\nProof of Stake supporters argue that PoS has some benefits over PoW, especially regarding scalability and transaction speed. It’s also said that PoS coins are less harmful to the environment when compared to PoW. In contrast, many PoW supporters argue that PoS, as a newer technology, is yet to prove its potential in terms of network security. The fact that PoW networks require significant amounts of resources (mining hardware, electricity, etc.) makes them more expensive to attack. This is particularly true for Bitcoin, as the biggest PoW blockchain.\nAs mentioned, is expected to switch from PoW to PoS in the upgrade. ETH 2.0 is a long-anticipated upgrade to the Ethereum network to improve its performance and address its scalability issue. After the implementation of PoS on Ethereum, anyone with at least 32 ETH will be able to participate in staking to become a validator and receive rewards. \nOn the Proof of Work blockchains, mining involves using computing power to hash the block’s data until a valid solution is found. For major cryptocurrencies today, the solutions are getting more challenging to find and the process of guessing massive amounts of hashes can be expensive in terms of hardware and electricity.\nTherefore, some miners prefer to accumulate their mining resources in for a greater chance to get the block rewards. Some big mining pools invest millions of dollars and control thousands of mining hardware to generate as much power as possible.\nAs of December 2021, the top 4 mining pools together control around 50% of the total Bitcoin hashing power. The domination of mining pools makes it more challenging for individual crypto enthusiasts to mine a block on their own. \nBut just how decentralized is mining then? On one side, there is still no single entity that can control confirmations on the network. If this occurred, a 51% attack would be possible and the network would lose its value. Some might argue that while mining is still decentralized, it is no longer heavily decentralized. Certain areas, mining equipment producers, and energy producers still dominate mining and reduce overall decentralization for proof of work blockchains.\nThe Proof of Stake consensus mechanism takes a different approach and replaces mining power for staking. This mechanism lowers the barriers to entry for an individual to confirm transactions, reducing the emphasis on location, equipment, and other factors. Your stake is simply determined by the amount of tokens you have.\nHowever, most PoS networks require you to run a validator node to begin confirming transactions. This can be expensive to run, but not as much as several mining rigs. Users then stake their tokens behind certain validators, giving us a similar model to mining pools. So while Proof of Stake is easier to participate in for an average user, it is still susceptible to the same centralization issue as mining pools.\nIn addition to centralization risk, the fact that the top four mining pools have the majority of hashing power of the Bitcoin network could potentially increase the risk of a . A 51% attack refers to a potential attack on the security of a blockchain system by a malicious actor or organization that manages to control over 50% of the total network hashing power. The attacker could override the blockchain consensus algorithm and commit malicious acts to benefit themselves, such as double spending, rejecting or altering transaction records, or preventing others from mining. However, this is unlikely to happen on Bitcoin due to the size of its network.\nIn contrast, if someone were to attack a PoS blockchain, they would have to own more than 50% of the coins on the network. This would cause the demand in the market and the coin price to rise, which could cost tens of billions of dollars. Even if they do commit a 51% attack, the value of their staked coins would go down drastically as the network gets compromised. Therefore it is not very likely for a 51% attack to happen on a crypto that uses the PoS consensus, especially if it's a large market cap one.\nMany see Proof of Stake as a better alternative to Proof of Work, but it’s worth noting that there are also shortcomings in the PoS algorithm. Due to the reward distribution mechanism, validators with more assets staked can increase their chances to validate the next block. The more coins a validator accumulates, the more coins they can stake and earn, which some people criticize as “making the rich richer”. These “richer” validators can also influence the voting on the network, as PoS blockchains often grant validators governance rights.\nAnother concern is security risks for smaller market cap crypto that adopts PoS. As mentioned, it is not very likely that a 51% attack would happen on the more popular cryptocurrencies like ETH or BNB. However, smaller digital assets with a lower value are more vulnerable to attacks. The attackers could potentially acquire enough coins to gain an advantage against other validators. They could exploit the PoS system by being frequently chosen to become validators. The rewards they earned can then be used for further staking and increase their chance to be chosen in the next round.\nProof of Work and Proof of Stake both have their place in the crypto ecosystem, and it is hard to say with certainty which consensus protocol works better. PoW might be criticized for creating high carbon emissions during mining, but it has proven itself as a secure algorithm to protect blockchain networks. Nevertheless, as Ethereum shifts from PoW to PoS, the Proof of Stake system could be more favored by new projects in the future.\n",

      "markdown": "\n\nCryptocurrencies aren’t all about volatility. In fact, stablecoins are specifically designed to maintain a fixed price. In an industry where coins and tokens can crash overnight, there is a massive demand for currencies that mix blockchain benefits with the ability to track a more stable asset. If you haven’t started using stablecoins while trading or investing, it’s worth learning more about them as well as the benefits and drawbacks they bring.\nor other assets. For example, you can purchase tokens pegged to the dollar, euro, yen, and even gold and oil. A stablecoin allows the holder to lock in profits and losses and transfer value at a stable price on peer-to-peer blockchain networks.\nfor day-to-day payments. For example, merchants may take $5 in BTC for a coffee one day but find that their BTC is worth 50% less the next. This makes it challenging to plan and operate a business that accepts crypto payments.\nBefore, crypto investors and traders had no way to lock in a profit or avoid volatility without converting crypto back into fiat. The creation of stablecoins provided a simple solution to these issues. Today, you can easily get in and out of crypto volatility using stablecoins like TrueUSD (TUSD).\nA fiat-backed stablecoin keeps a fiat currency, such as USD or GBP, in reserves. For example, each TUSD is backed by $1 held as collateral. Users can then convert their fiat to a stablecoin and vice versa at the pegged rate.\nCrypto-backed stablecoins work in a similar way to fiat-backed stablecoins. But instead of using dollars or another currency as reserve, we have cryptocurrencies acting as collateral. As the crypto market is highly volatile, crypto-backed stablecoins usually over-collateralize the reserves as a measure against price swings.\nCrypto-backed stablecoins use smart contracts to manage minting and burning. This makes the process more reliable as users can independently audit the contracts. However, some crypto-backed stablecoins are run by \nLet’s look at an example. To mint 100 DAI pegged to USD, you will need to provide $150 of crypto as 1.5x collateral. Once you have your DAI, you can use it however you want. You could transfer it, invest it, or simply keep it as is. If you want your collateral back, you’ll need to pay back the 100 DAI. However, if your collateral drops below a certain collateral ratio or the loan’s value, it will be liquidated.\nWhen the stablecoin is below $1, incentives are created for holders to return their stablecoin for the collateral. This decreases the supply of the coin, causing the price to rise back to $1. When it’s above $1, users are incentivized to create the token, increasing its supply and lowering the price. DAI is just one example, but all crypto-backed stablecoins rely on a mix of \nEssentially, an algorithmic stablecoin system will reduce the token supply if the price falls below the fiat currency it tracks.

As they are designed to maintain a stable price, they are useful for reasons other than speculation. They can also facilitate high-speed transactions internationally at a low cost. Some countries are even experimenting with creating their own stablecoins. As a stablecoin is a type of cryptocurrency, it will likely fall under the same regulations as crypto in your local jurisdiction. Issuing stablecoins with fiat reserves may also need regulatory approval.\nIt’s hard to find an investor or trader nowadays who hasn’t held a stablecoin at some point. Stablecoins are often held in crypto exchanges so that traders can quickly capitalize on new market opportunities. They're also very useful to enter and exit positions without having to cash out into fiat. Apart from trading and investing, stablecoins can be used for making payments and international transfers.\nEven though they are an integral part of crypto and have enabled the creation of a new financial system, you shouldn’t underestimate the risks. We’ve seen stablecoin projects with failing pegs, missing reserves, and lawsuits. So while stablecoins are incredibly versatile tools, do bear in mind that they're still cryptocurrencies and hold similar risks. You can mitigate risks by diversifying your portfolio, but make sure to do your own research before investing or trading, and don't invest more than you can afford to lose.\n_This content is presented to you on an “as is” basis for general information and educational purposes only, without representation or warranty of any kind.

      "markdown": "\n\nSince Bitcoin kicked off the cryptocurrency revolution in 2009, the market has grown wildly, spawning thousands of tokens. One of the things that determines whether a crypto project thrives or fails is its tokenomics—that is, how its token’s economy is designed and managed. \nTokenomics (a blend of the words “token” and “economics”) covers the economic factors that define how a cryptocurrency works. This includes how many tokens (or coins) exist, how they’re launched into the market, what they can be used for, and the incentives designed to motivate users and maintain the network’s health.\n  *   * How many tokens are currently out in the market, accessible to users and traders. The amount can go up or down based on minting new tokens, burning existing ones, or tokens locked away in vesting schedules.\n  * \n\n\nAside from supply and demand, it’s important to look at distribution. How tokens get spread out when a project launches can impact how decentralized and stable it will be in the medium and long term.\n  *   * : Some tokens are set aside for founders, investors, or institutions before the public launch, as seen with many altcoins. While this helps fund development early on, it can concentrate ownership and increase the risk of large holders affecting the market.\n\n\nYou should also look at a token’s lock-up and release schedule to see if a large number of tokens will be placed into circulation, which often puts downward pressure on the token’s value.\n\n\nSince Bitcoin’s simple but groundbreaking design, tokenomics has become far more diverse and complex. Early models focused on simple emission schedules and rewards. Today, projects experiment with dynamic supply policies, custom governance models, algorithmic \nTokenomics and cryptoeconomics are related concepts, but not exactly the same. Tokenomics refers to the economic framework of a particular token or cryptocurrency, covering the aspects we discussed above: supply, allocation, utility, etc. \nBy looking at supply dynamics, use cases, distribution, and incentive models, you can better judge whether a project is likely to succeed or not. No one factor tells the whole story, but having solid tokenomics is an important first step toward long-term success and network growth.\n_Disclaimer: This content is presented to you on an “as is” basis for general information and educational purposes only, without representation or warranty of any kind.

This guide will walk you through the fundamentals of cryptocurrency trading — including how to get started, the basic terminology, different types of trading strategies, and how to manage risk.\ntrading refers to buying and selling digital assets on exchanges for the purpose of making a profit. Unlike traditional markets, crypto markets operate 24/7, giving traders more flexibility but also exposing them to constant price changes.\n” (selling an asset expecting its price to drop). Some traders hold assets for longer periods, while others prefer to move in and out of positions quickly, depending on their strategy and risk tolerance (more on these strategies soon).\nYou can trade cryptocurrencies against fiat currencies (such as USD, EUR, etc.) or against other cryptocurrencies. The assets you choose and the exchange you use will affect your trading experience.\ninto your account. Most centralized exchanges allow users to deposit fiat via bank transfers, bank wires, or other common methods. Depending on the platform and location, you may also be able to buy crypto using a credit card. \nIf you happen to own some crypto already, you can deposit it into your exchange account. Remember to always send your coins to the associated address: send Bitcoin to your Bitcoin address, ether to your Ethereum address, and so on. Sending crypto to the wrong addresses may result in permanent losses.\nCrypto-to-fiat trading pairs involve a cryptocurrency and a traditional fiat currency, such as the BTC/EUR trading pair. If the current value of one BTC is 92,175 euros, the BTC/EUR trading pair chart will show the same value as the market price. \nIn other words, you need 92,175 euros to buy 1 BTC, half of that to buy 0.5 BTC, and so on. Note that you can buy as little as 5 EUR worth of bitcoin.\nCrypto-to-crypto trading pairs involve two different cryptocurrencies, such as the ETH/BTC trading pair. At the time of writing, ether (ETH) is being traded at 0.02285 BTC per unit of ETH.\nis a real-time, dynamic list of buy and sell orders placed by traders. It provides a snapshot of the supply and demand for a specific asset at different price levels.\nBuy orders (bids) list the orders from traders who want to buy, organized from the highest bid price to the lowest. Sell orders (asks) display the orders from traders who want to sell, organized from the lowest ask price to the highest.\nis the simplest type of order, in which you buy or sell immediately at the best available price. It’s the fastest way to buy or sell when you don’t want to wait.\nLet's say the current highest bid (buy order) for one bitcoin is $100,000, while the lowest ask (sell order) is $100,100. If you place a market order to buy BTC, your order will be matched with the lowest ask, which is $100,100. If you place a market order to sell BTC, your order will be matched with the highest bid at $100,000.\nis an order to buy or sell at a specific price or better. It’s a slower way to buy or sell but allows you to set the exact price you want.\nFor example, if bitcoin is trading for $100,000 but you want to buy it for $98,000 or less, you can set a buy limit order at $98,000. If the price drops to $98,000 or less, your limit order will (likely) be executed, and you'll purchase bitcoin at the desired price. But if the price never drops to your limit price, your order won't be executed.\nThink about your trading style and strategy. Every trader is unique, so it’s usually better to create your own trading system and improve it as you go rather than copying other traders. This will help you improve and hopefully achieve a more consistent trading performance in the long term.\nto determine which assets to trade. This trading style can be profitable, but it’s challenging and definitely not for everyone. Day trading tends to be more stressful and time-consuming than swing trading or long-term HODLing, so it’s generally \n, you’re still trying to profit off market trends, but the time horizon is longer – positions are typically held anywhere from a couple of days to a couple of months. Swing trading tends to be a more \ntakes place across the smallest time frames. Scalpers attempt to game small fluctuations in price, often entering and exiting positions within minutes (or even seconds). As a form of day trading, scalping is also \nor other inefficiencies to make a profit. Due to the short time frames, scalping usually has thin profit margins. Scalpers generally trade bigger volumes or dozens of trades to gradually achieve sizable profits.\nIt’s ideal for those who believe in the long-term potential of specific assets and are willing to weather short-term price fluctuations. While this strategy requires patience, it can provide substantial returns over time, especially for bitcoin holders.\nFor example, a 1-hour chart shows candlesticks that each represent a period of one hour. A 1-day chart shows candlesticks that each represent a period of one day, and so on.\nA candlestick is made up of four data points: the Open, High, Low, and Close (also referred to as the OHLC values). The Open (1) and Close (4) are the first and last recorded prices for the given timeframe, while the High (2) and Low (3) are the highest and lowest recorded prices, respectively.\nFundamental analysis is a method used by investors and traders to determine the intrinsic value of an asset or business. In crypto trading, it often involves investigating the technology, team, adoption potential, and overall viability of a project.\nUse advanced order types to lock in profits or protect yourself from losses. For instance, stop-loss orders allow traders to limit losses when a trade goes wrong. Take-profit orders ensure that you lock in profits when a trade goes well.\nis an essential way to manage your risks. It's easy to get caught up in a bull market and its euphoria, but having a plan to exit your position can help lock in gains or prevent big losses in case things go bad.\nOne way is to use limit orders to take profit or place a floor on maximum loss that you can stand. As a general rule of thumb, once you have your exit plan, you should stick to it. \nDiversifying your portfolio is one way to reduce your overall risk. You can hold a variety of different assets, keep each position at an appropriate size, and constantly rebalance the portfolio, so you won't be too heavily invested in any one asset. This can minimize the chance of oversized losses.\nAlthough this requires a bit more experience, you can consider hedging your open positions, which means taking a position in a related asset that is expected to move in the opposite direction of the primary position. The purpose is to offset potential losses.\nIf Bitcoin's price falls to $80,000, you can exercise your option and sell for $100,000, significantly reducing your losses. If the price doesn’t fall, you only lose the premium paid while still profiting from the uptrend of your long position.\n_Disclaimer: This content is presented to you on an “as is” basis for general information and educational purposes only, without representation or warranty of any kind.

      "markdown": "A centralized exchange (CEX) offers cryptocurrency exchange services to registered users. Its primary service typically matches buyers and sellers with an order book, though a CEX may offer its verified users various crypto products. For beginners, a CEX provides the simplest way to get started without needing in-depth knowledge of blockchain infrastructure and tools.\nA decentralized exchange (DEX) uses on-chain smart contracts to run its exchange services. In most cases, users swap tokens from liquidity pools, with liquidity provided by other users in exchange for swap fees. \n) world and provide users with a lot of freedom. However, they lack the support a CEX can give, and it can be easy to make irreversible mistakes when using them.\nIf you've been doing your crypto research, you'll likely have come across DEXs. Perhaps you're already a customer with a CEX like Binance but are interested in using a DEX, or maybe you're looking to purchase the latest DeFi coin not currently available on CEXs.\nNo matter your story, you should know the crucial differences between a CEX and DEX before deciding which to use. Depending on what you want to do and your level of experience, each has its advantages and disadvantages.\nFor newcomers, a CEX offers a more user-friendly experience and is an easier entry point. If anything goes wrong, you can contact the exchange's customer support team. A DEX also has several benefits but these are typically more attractive to experienced crypto users who value decentralization over ease of use.\nThe process of registering with a CEX is similar to opening a bank account. Many of us are already familiar with this system, and technical knowledge is not a must-have. Most CEXs offer payment with credit or debit cards, making your first crypto investment as simple as possible.\n, gas fees, and other aspects of blockchain can be unforgiving when you make mistakes. There are no system admins to offer assistance, so you're on your own if you lose your \nYou can avoid these pitfalls if you trade using a CEX. For example, customer support can help if you lose access to your Binance account, and there's no need to pay gas fees when moving your crypto around Binance's products. These measures support users and protect them from making the irreversible mistakes people sometimes make on DEXs.\n, and more without leaving the platform. Moreover, moving funds among these different areas is simple. You can pay by card and even enjoy deals with partner merchants like Travala.\nAs large centralized entities, CEXs are frequently the targets of attacks, which means any user funds stored on a CEX are susceptible to theft. While CEXs prioritize security, they cannot eliminate the risk of hacks and theft. Over the years, several high-profile hacks have occurred, such as the Mt. Gox hack.\nAlmost every — if not every — service you use on a CEX will incur a transaction fee. Often, it may be hidden or \"baked into\" the service. Due to their higher operating costs, CEXs may struggle to compete with the low transaction fees offered by DEXs. However, a CEX’s additional transaction fees must be weighed against the gas fees of using a DEX, which can be considerable on some networks.\nWhen using a CEX, you must deposit your crypto into its wallet. This means you relinquish custody of your funds by entrusting them to the CEX. As such, you may be unable to withdraw them whenever you please. This is problematic if an exchange becomes insolvent and can lead to you losing your funds entirely. This situation is similar to storing your cash with a bank — during a run on the bank, you may not be able to access your funds. \nWhen using a DEX, you never lose custody of your funds until a trade or interaction is complete. This means you can move and store them as you wish. If your crypto is stored in a wallet whose seed phrase only you can access, \nWhen using a DEX, there’s no need to supply personal, identifying information and trust it to be stored securely. This means your personal data is safe from bad actors who want to steal your identity. Note that when using an exchange, you are still bound by local regulations and laws. \nUsing a DEX requires only a wallet and some crypto to trade and pay gas fees. This makes DEXs highly accessible to a larger group of people globally. For decentralization fans, this is a huge benefit, and many value the more private nature of a DEX. Of course, this should also be considered in the context of local legislation, as well as relevant debates on crypto regulation.\nHistorically, buying your first coin or token was one of the most significant barriers to gaining crypto exposure. CEXs now, as a standard, offer credit and debit card options for buying crypto. Although some DEXs are beginning to offer this service with third-party providers, most still don't allow credit or debit card usage. \ncan be smaller, and large trades on a DEX may have a more significant price impact than if done on a CEX. Traders or investors making large volume orders can often find a better price doing over-the-counter (OTC) trades or using a CEX with deep order books, like Binance.\nBy far, the simplest experience for a crypto beginner is to use a CEX. It removes the initial learning curve associated with decentralized blockchain infrastructure. If you face any issues using a CEX, a support team will help and guide you as much as possible.\nOverall, the chances of making an irreversible mistake like losing access to your funds or transferring it to the wrong address are much lower with a CEX. So if it's your first time gaining crypto exposure or you prefer a more straightforward, digestible service, a CEX is for you.\nIf you’re considering trying out a DEX, you need to do your own research beyond what is mentioned this guide. Though the benefits sound appealing to some, we recommend making sure you fully understand how to use one and its associated tools.\narticle. If you’re happy with the services offered by the CEX you’re using, there’s no need to switch. For many, a CEX offers the right balance of ease of use and available support.\n",

      "markdown": "  * A cryptocurrency is a digital asset based on a blockchain network that is distributed across a large number of computers. This decentralized structure allows them to exist outside the direct control of governments and central authorities.\n\n\nA cryptocurrency is a digital or virtual currency secured by cryptography, which makes it nearly impossible to counterfeit or double-spend. Cryptocurrencies exist on decentralized networks that utilize blockchain technology—a distributed ledger secured by a network of computers. \nA defining feature of cryptocurrencies is that they are generally not issued by any central or governing authority. However, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) set rules that , , and other institutions that offer cryptocurrency must follow. \nCryptocurrencies are digital currencies underpinned by cryptographic systems. They enable secure online payments without the use of third-party intermediaries. \"Crypto\" refers to the various encryption algorithms and cryptographic techniques that safeguard these entries, such as elliptic curve encryption, public-private key pairs, and hashing functions. \nis central to Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies' appeal and functionality. A blockchain is essentially a set of connected blocks of information on an online ledger. Each block contains a set of transactions that have been verified by validators on a network. \nThe offers that appear in this table are from partnerships from which Investopedia receives compensation. This compensation may impact how and where listings appear. Investopedia does not include all offers available in the marketplace.\nThis network-wide validation makes it nearly impossible to forge transactions. The contents of the online ledger must be agreed upon by a network of individual nodes, or computers that maintain the ledger. \nExperts say that blockchain technology can serve multiple industries, supply chains, and processes, such as online voting and crowdfunding. For example, financial institutions like JPMorgan Chase () have developed and used blockchain technology to reduce transaction costs by streamlining payment processing. \nMany cryptocurrencies were created to facilitate work done on the blockchain they are built on. For example, digital coin, , is used to pay for validating transactions and creating new blocks. In September 2022, Ethereum switched to a system. Ether inherited an additional duty as the blockchain's staking mechanism. The XRP Ledger's native cryptocurrency, XRP, facilitates transfers between different geographies. \nBecause so many cryptocurrencies are on the market, it's important to understand the different types. Knowing whether the coin you're looking at has a purpose can help you decide whether it is worth investing in—a cryptocurrency with a purpose is likely to be less risky than one that doesn't have a use. \nMost of the time, when you hear about cryptocurrency types, you hear the coin's name. However, coin names differ from coin types. Here are some of the types you'll find, with some of the names of tokens in that category: \n  * : Tokens representing ownership of an asset, such as a tokenized stock (value transferred to the blockchain). MS Token is an example of a securitized token. If you can find one for sale, you can gain partial ownership of the Millennium Sapphire. \n\n\nIf you want to use cryptocurrency to buy products and services, you will need to visit a . These are businesses that allow you to buy or sell cryptocurrencies from other users at the current market price, similar to a stock. After buying the coins, you will need to transfer them to a or use a third-party service like Coinbase to store your coins. \nIf you only want to buy cryptocurrency as an investment, you may be able to do so through your For example, , one of our top , allows users to invest in Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. Several crypto ETFs, such as Spot Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs, also give you exposure to the crypto without having to maintain their wallets. Investors may choose to hold shares or Ether spot shares, which the SEC approved. \nFiat currencies derive their authority from the government or monetary authorities. For example, the U.S. dollar is recognized and issued by the government as the official currency of the United States and is \"legal tender.\" \nHowever, cryptocurrencies are not issued by any government entity. Therefore, it has been difficult to make a case for their legal status in different financial jurisdictions throughout the world. It doesn't help matters that cryptocurrencies have primarily functioned outside most existing financial infrastructure. If you're interested in cryptocurrency, check the national and local laws of your country of residence. While it may be , it may not be legal in another. \nThe legal status of cryptocurrencies creates implications for their use in daily transactions and trading. In June 2019, the recommended that crypto wire transfers should be subject to the requirements of its Travel Rule, which requires AML compliance. \nAlthough cryptocurrencies are considered money, the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) treats them like financial assets or property for tax purposes. And, as with most other investments, if you have capital gains from selling or trading crypto, the government wants a piece of the profits. How digital assets are taxed, either as capital gains or ordinary income, depends on how long you held them for and how you used them.\nEnthusiasts called it a crypto victory. But the exchanges are regulated by the SEC, as are coin offerings or sales to institutional investors. So, crypto is legal in the U.S., but regulatory agencies are slowly gaining ground in the industry. As of August 2025, regulators are developing rules for cryptocurrency distribution, trading, and custody that will contribute to an eventual framework. \nCryptocurrencies are legal in the European Union. Derivatives and other products that use them must qualify as financial instruments. In June 2023, the European Commission's Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) regulation went into effect. The law sets safeguards and establishes rules for companies or vendors providing financial services using cryptocurrencies. \nCryptocurrencies have attracted a reputation as unstable investments due to high investor losses from scams, hacks, bugs, and volatility. Although the underlying cryptography and blockchain are generally secure, the technical complexity of using and storing crypto assets can be a significant hazard to new users. \n  * : Unlike traditional finance, you can't reverse or cancel a cryptocurrency transaction after it has already been sent. According to Ledger, a well-known crypto wallet, analysts estimate that about 11 % to 18% of bitcoins are lost for various reasons. \n  * : The regulatory status of some cryptocurrencies is still unclear in many areas, with some governments seeking to regulate them as securities, currencies, or both. A sudden crackdown could make it challenging to sell crypto or cause a market-wide price drop.\n  * : Due to the lack of coherent regulations, there are few protections against deceptive or unethical management practices. Many investors have lost large sums to management teams that failed to deliver a product.\n\n\nDespite these risks, cryptocurrencies have experienced a significant price surge, with the total market capitalization rising to approximately $2.98 trillion as of December 15, 2025. Despite the asset's speculative nature, some have created substantial fortunes by taking on the risk of investing in early-stage cryptocurrencies. \nCryptocurrencies were introduced with the intent to revolutionize financial infrastructure. As with every revolution, however, there are tradeoffs involved. At the current stage of development for cryptocurrencies, there are many differences between the theoretical ideal of a decentralized system with cryptocurrencies and its practical implementation. \nCryptocurrencies represent . In this system, centralized intermediaries, such as banks and monetary institutions, are not necessary to enforce trust and police transactions between two parties. Thus, a system with cryptocurrencies eliminates the possibility of a single point of failure—such as a large financial institution setting off a cascade of global crises, such as the one triggered in 2008 by the failure of large investment banks in the U.S. \nCryptocurrencies promise to make transferring funds directly between two parties easier without needing a trusted third party like a bank or a credit card company. Such decentralized transfers are secured by the use of and and different forms of incentive systems, such as proof of work or proof of stake. \nBecause they do not use third-party intermediaries, cryptocurrency transfers between two transacting parties can be faster than standard money transfers. Flash loans in decentralized finance are an excellent example of such decentralized transfers. These loans, which are processed without requiring collateral, can be executed within seconds and are mostly used in trading. \nThe remittance economy is testing one of cryptocurrency's most prominent use cases. Cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin serve as intermediate currencies to streamline money transfers across borders. Thus, a fiat currency is converted into Bitcoin (or another cryptocurrency), transferred across borders, and subsequently converted back into the destination fiat currency without third-party involvement. \nThough many claim crypto to be an anonymous form of transaction, cryptocurrencies are pseudonymous. They leave a digital trail that agencies like the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) can follow. This opens up the possibility for governments, authorities, and others to track financial transactions. \nCryptocurrencies have become a popular tool for criminals to engage in nefarious activities, including money laundering and illicit purchases. The case of , who ran a marketplace to sell drugs on the dark web, is already well known. Cryptocurrencies have also become a favorite of hackers who use them for ransomware activities. \nIn theory, cryptocurrencies are designed to be decentralized, with their wealth distributed among many parties on a blockchain. Ownership is becoming more concentrated, as witnessed by such as Strategy purchasing and holding them for price appreciation and investment fund managers buying them to hold in the funds they manage. \nOne of the conceits of cryptocurrencies is that anyone can mine them using a computer with an Internet connection. However, mining popular cryptocurrencies requires considerable energy, sometimes with daily energy use for mining only exceeding that of a household. The high energy costs and the unpredictability of mining have concentrated mining among large firms seeking to profit from the activity. \nThough cryptocurrency blockchains are highly secure, off-chain crypto-related key storage repositories, such as exchanges and wallets, can be hacked. Many cryptocurrency exchanges and wallets have been hacked over the years, sometimes resulting in the theft of millions of dollars in coins. \nCryptocurrencies traded in public markets suffer from price volatility, so investments . For example, Bitcoin's value has experienced rapid surges and crashes, climbing to nearly $65,000 in November 2021 before dropping to just over $20,000 a year and a half later. Bitcoin prices roared back by mid-2024 and reached a high of more than $124,000 by October 2025. As a result of this vast range of volatility, many people consider cryptocurrencies a speculative bubble. \nCrypto can be a good investment for someone who enjoys speculating and can financially tolerate losing everything invested. However, it is not a wise investment for someone seeking to grow their retirement portfolio or for placing savings into it for growth.\nIt depends on your financial circumstances, market outlook, risk tolerance, and goals. Crypto investing is generally best suited for speculators or those who can afford to incur losses. Including cryptocurrency as part of a portfolio is something that should be discussed with a financial advisor familiar with crypto.\nThere are several ways cryptocurrency can make money for you. Decentralized finance applications let you loan your crypto with interest; you can stake a compatible one on a blockchain or at certain exchanges for rewards, or you can hold on to it and hope its market value increases.

      "markdown": "\n\nBlockchain is a decentralized digital database or ledger that securely stores records across a network of computers in a way that is transparent, immutable, and resistant to tampering. Each \"block\" contains data, and the blocks are linked in a chronological \"chain.\"\n\n\nA blockchain is a distributed database or ledger shared across a computer network's nodes. While it is best known for its crucial role in cryptocurrency systems, maintaining a secure and decentralized record of transactions, blockchains are not limited to cryptocurrency uses. Blockchains can be used to make data in any industry immutable, meaning it cannot be altered. \nSince a block can’t be changed, the only trust needed is at the point where a user or program enters data. This reduces the need for trusted third parties, such as auditors or other humans, who add costs and can make mistakes. \nSince Bitcoin's introduction in 2009, blockchain use has exploded due to the creation of various cryptocurrencies, decentralized finance (DeFi) applications, non-fungible tokens (NFTs), and smart contracts. Bitcoin and other popular cryptocurrencies, such as Ethereum and Solana, can be purchased through leading . \nYou might be familiar with spreadsheets or databases. A blockchain is somewhat similar because it is a database where information is entered and stored. The key difference between a traditional database or spreadsheet and a blockchain is how the data is structured and accessed. \nThe offers that appear in this table are from partnerships from which Investopedia receives compensation. This compensation may impact how and where listings appear. Investopedia does not include all offers available in the marketplace.\nA blockchain consists of programs called scripts that conduct the tasks you usually would in a database: entering and accessing information, and . A blockchain is distributed, meaning multiple copies are saved on many machines and must match for it to be valid. \nThe Bitcoin blockchain collects transaction information and enters it into a 4MB file called a (different blockchains have different-sized blocks). Once the block is full, the block data is run through a cryptographic hash function, which creates a hexadecimal number called the hash. \nTransactions follow a specific process, depending on the blockchain. For example, on Bitcoin's blockchain, if you initiate a transaction using your —the application that provides an interface for the blockchain—it starts a sequence of events. \nIn Bitcoin, your transaction is sent to a memory pool, where it is stored and queued until a miner picks it up. Once it is entered into a block and the block fills up with transactions, it is closed, and the mining begins. \nEvery node in the network proposes its own blocks in this way because it chooses different transactions. Each works on their own blocks, trying to find a solution to the difficulty target, using the \"nonce,\" short for number used once. \nThe nonce value is a field in the block header that is changeable, and its value incrementally increases with every mining attempt. If the resulting hash isn't equal to or less than the target hash, a value of one is added to the nonce, a new hash is generated, and so on. The nonce rolls over about every 4.5 billion attempts (which takes less than one second) and uses another value called the extra nonce as an additional counter. This continues until a miner generates a valid hash, winning the race and receiving . \nOnce a block is closed, a transaction is complete. But the block isn't confirmed until five other blocks are validated. to complete because it averages just under 10 minutes per block (the first block with your transaction and five following blocks multiplied by 10 equals 60 minutes). \nNot all blockchains follow this process. For instance, the network randomly chooses one validator from all users with ether staked to validate blocks, which are then confirmed by the network. It's a faster and less energy-intensive process than Bitcoin's. \nA blockchain allows the data in a database to be spread out among several network nodes—computers or devices running software for the blockchain—at various locations. This creates redundancy and maintains the fidelity of the data. For example, if someone tries to alter a record on one node, the other nodes would prevent it from happening by comparing block hashes. This way, no single node can alter information within the chain. \nBecause of this distribution—and the encrypted proof that work was done—the blockchain data, such as transaction history, becomes irreversible. Such a record could be a list of transactions, but private blockchains can also hold a variety of other information, like legal contracts, state identifications, or a company's inventory. Most blockchains wouldn't \"store\" these items directly; they would likely be sent through a hashing algorithm and represented on the blockchain by a token. \nThe Bitcoin blockchain is decentralized, so all transactions are transparently viewable by downloading and inspecting them or by using blockchain explorers that permit anyone to see live transactions. Each node has its own copy of the updated chain as fresh blocks are confirmed and added. This means that if you wanted to, you could track a bitcoin wherever it goes. \nFor example, crypto exchanges have been hacked in the past, resulting in the loss of large amounts of cryptocurrency. Although anonymous (except for their wallet address), the crypto that hackers extracted is easily traceable because the wallet addresses are stored on the blockchain. \nOf course, the records stored in the Bitcoin blockchain (as well as most others) are encrypted. This means that only the person assigned an address can reveal their identity. As a result, blockchain users can remain anonymous while preserving transparency. \nBlockchain technology achieves decentralized security and trust in several ways. To begin, new blocks are always stored linearly and chronologically. That is, they are always added to the \"end\" of the blockchain. After a block has been added to the end of the blockchain, previous blocks cannot be altered. \nA change in any data changes the hash of the block it was in. Because each block contains the previous block's hash, a change in one would change the following blocks. The network would generally reject an altered block because the hashes would not match. However, a change can be accomplished on smaller blockchain networks. \nNot all blockchains are 100% impenetrable. They are distributed ledgers that use code to create the security level they have become known for. If there are vulnerabilities in the coding, they can be exploited.\nA new and smaller chain might be susceptible to this kind of attack, but the attacker would need at least half of the network's computational power (). On the Bitcoin and other larger blockchains, this is nearly impossible. By the time the hacker takes any action, the network is likely to have moved past the blocks they were trying to alter. This is because the rate at which these networks hash is exceptionally rapid—the Bitcoin network hashed at a rate of around 931 exahashes per second as of Dec. 15, 2025. \nThe Ethereum blockchain is not likely to be hacked either—again, the attackers would need to control more than half of the blockchain's staked ether. As of Dec. 13, 2025, approximately 34.67 million ETH were staked by more than one million validators. An attacker or group would need to own about 18 million ETH and be randomly selected to validate blocks enough to get their blocks implemented. \nBlockchain technology was first outlined in 1991 by Stuart Haber and W. Scott Stornetta, two researchers who wanted to implement a system where document timestamps couldn't be tampered with. But it wasn’t until almost two decades later, with the launch of Bitcoin in January 2009, that . \nis built on a blockchain. In a research paper introducing the digital currency, Bitcoin’s pseudonymous creator, , referred to it as “a new electronic cash system that’s fully peer-to-peer, with no trusted third party.” \nBlockchain can be used to immutably record any number of data points. The data can be transactions, votes in an election, product inventories, state identifications, deeds to homes, and much more. \nCurrently, tens of thousands of projects are looking to implement blockchains in various ways to help society, other than just recording transactions—for example, as a way to vote securely in democratic elections. \nThe nature of blockchain's immutability means that fraudulent voting would become far more difficult. For example, a voting system could work such that each country's citizens would be issued a single cryptocurrency or token. \nEach candidate could then be given a specific wallet address, and the voters would send their token or crypto to the address of whichever candidate they wish to vote for. The transparent and traceable nature of blockchain would eliminate the need for human vote counting and the ability of bad actors to tamper with physical ballots. \nAs we now know, blocks on Bitcoin’s blockchain store transactional data. Today, tens of thousands of other cryptocurrencies run on a blockchain. However, blockchain can also be a reliable way to store other types of data. \nSome companies that are experimenting with blockchain include Walmart, Pfizer, AIG, Siemens, Unilever, and others. For example, IBM's Food Trust blockchain can trace the journey of food products through the supply chain, showing their point of origin and the path between suppliers. This can improve transparency in food safety investigations. \nThe food industry experienced many outbreaks of E. coli, Salmonella, and Listeria, and, in some cases, the introduction of hazardous materials to food products. It took weeks to trace where the outbreaks started in the past without this technology. \nUsing blockchain allows brands to track a food product’s route from its origin through each step in the supply chain, up to and including delivery. This helps companies quickly identify affected products when there are food safety issues, reducing the potential for harm. This is one example of blockchain in practice, with many other implementations already in use or under development. \nPerhaps no industry stands to benefit from integrating blockchain into its business operations more than personal banking. Financial institutions only operate during business hours, usually five days a week. That means if you try to deposit a check on Friday at 6 p.m., you will likely have to wait until Monday morning to see the money in your account. \nEven if you make your deposit during business hours, the transaction can still take one to three days to verify due to the sheer volume of transactions that banks need to settle. Blockchain, on the other hand, never sleeps. \nBy integrating blockchain into banks, consumers might see their transactions processed in minutes or seconds—the time it takes to add a block to the blockchain, regardless of holidays or the time of day or week. With blockchain, banks also have the opportunity to exchange funds between institutions more quickly and securely. Given the sums involved, even the few days the money is in transit can carry high costs and risks for banks. \nThe for stock traders can take up to one day for settlement (or longer if trading internationally), meaning that the money and shares are frozen for that period. Blockchain can, in theory, drastically reduce that time. \nBlockchain forms the bedrock for cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin. This design also allows for easier cross-border transactions because it bypasses currency restrictions, instabilities, or lack of infrastructure by using a distributed network that can reach anyone with an internet connection. \nHealthcare providers can leverage blockchain to store their patients’ medical records securely. When a medical record is generated and signed, it can be written into the blockchain, which provides patients with proof and confidence that the record cannot be changed. These personal health records could be encoded and stored on the blockchain with a private key so that they are only accessible to specific individuals, thereby ensuring privacy. \nIf you have ever spent time in your local Recorder’s Office, you will know that recording property rights is both burdensome and inefficient. Today, a physical deed must be delivered to a government employee at the local recording office, where it is manually entered into the county’s central database and public index. In the case of a property dispute, claims to the property must be reconciled with the public index. \nThis process is not only costly and time-consuming but also prone to human error. Each inaccuracy makes tracking property ownership less efficient. Blockchain has the potential to eliminate the need for scanning documents and tracking down physical files in a local recording office. If property ownership is stored and verified on the blockchain, owners can trust that their deed is accurate and permanently recorded. \nProving property ownership can be nearly impossible in war-torn countries or areas with little to no government or financial infrastructure and no Recorder’s Office. If a group of people living in such an area can leverage blockchain, then transparent and clear timelines of property ownership could be maintained. \nA smart contract is computer code that can be built into the blockchain to facilitate transactions. It operates under a set of conditions to which users agree. When those conditions are met, the smart contract conducts the transaction for the users. \nSuppliers can use blockchain to record the origins of materials they purchase. This would allow companies to verify the authenticity of not only their products but also common labels, such as “Organic,” “Local,” and “Fair Trade.” \nAs mentioned above, blockchain could facilitate a modern voting system. Voting with blockchain carries the potential to eliminate election fraud and boost voter turnout, as was tested in the November 2018 midterm elections in West Virginia. \nUsing blockchain like this would make votes nearly tamper-proof. The blockchain protocol would also maintain transparency in the electoral process, reducing the personnel needed to conduct an election and providing officials with nearly instant results. This would eliminate the need for recounts or any real concern that fraud might threaten the election. \nFor all of its complexity, blockchain’s potential as a decentralized form of record-keeping is almost without limit. From greater user privacy and heightened security to lower processing fees and fewer errors, blockchain technology may very well see applications beyond those outlined above. But there are also some disadvantages. \n\n\n\n\nTransactions on the blockchain network are approved by thousands of computers and devices. This removes almost all people from the verification process, resulting in less human error and an accurate record of information. Even if a computer on the network made a computational mistake, the error would only be made to one copy of the blockchain and not be accepted by the rest of the network. \nConsumers typically pay a bank to verify a transaction or a notary to sign a document. Blockchain eliminates the need for third-party verification—and, with it, their associated costs. For example, business owners incur a small fee when they accept credit card payments because banks and payment-processing companies have to process those transactions. Bitcoin, on the other hand, doesn't have a central authority and has limited transaction fees. \nBlockchain does not store any information in a central location. Instead, it is copied and spread across a network of computers. Whenever a new block is added to the blockchain, every computer on the network updates its blockchain to reflect the change. \nTransactions placed through a central authority can take up to a few days to settle. If you attempt to deposit a check on Friday evening, for example, you may not actually see funds in your account until Monday morning. Financial institutions operate during business hours, usually five days a week—but a blockchain runs 24 hours a day, seven days a week, and 365 days a year. \nOn some blockchains, transactions can be completed and considered secure in minutes. This is particularly useful for trades, which usually take much longer because of time zone issues and the fact that all parties must confirm payment processing. \nMany blockchain networks operate as public databases, meaning anyone with an internet connection can view a list of the network’s transaction history. Although users can access transaction details, they cannot access identifying information about the users making those transactions. It is a common misconception that blockchain networks like Bitcoin are fully anonymous; they are actually pseudonymous because there is a viewable address that can be associated with a user if the information gets out. \nOnce a transaction is recorded, its authenticity must be verified by the blockchain network. After the transaction is validated, it is added to the blockchain block. Each block on the blockchain contains its unique hash and the unique hash of the block before it. Therefore, the blocks cannot be altered once the network confirms them. \nMany blockchains are entirely . This means that everyone can view its code. This gives auditors the ability to review cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin for security. However, it also means there is no real authority on who controls Bitcoin’s code or how it is edited. Because of this, anyone can suggest changes or upgrades to the system. If a majority of the network users agree that the new version of the code with the upgrade is sound and worthwhile, then Bitcoin can be updated. \nPrivate or permissioned blockchains may not allow for public transparency, depending on how they are designed or their purpose. These types of blockchains might be made only for an organization that wishes to track data accurately without allowing anyone outside of the permissioned users to see it. \nAlternatively, there might come a point where publicly traded companies are required to provide investors with financial transparency through a regulator-approved blockchain reporting system. Using blockchains in business accounting and would prevent companies from altering their financials to appear more profitable than they really are. \nPerhaps the most profound facet of blockchain and cryptocurrency is the ability for anyone, regardless of ethnicity, gender, location, or cultural background, to use it. According to The World Bank, as of 2024 data, an estimated 1.3 billion adults don't have bank accounts or any means of storing their money or wealth. Moreover, nearly all of these individuals live in developing countries where the economy is in its infancy and entirely dependent on cash. \nThese people are often paid in physical cash. They then need to store this physical cash in hidden locations in their homes or other places, incentivizing robbers or violence. While not impossible to steal, crypto makes it more difficult for would-be thieves. \nAlthough blockchain can save users money on transaction fees, the technology is far from free. For example, the Bitcoin network's proof-of-work system to validate transactions consumes vast amounts of computational power. In the real world, the energy consumed by the millions of devices on the Bitcoin network is more than what Finland uses. \nSome solutions to these issues are beginning to arise. For example, bitcoin-mining farms have been set up to use solar power, excess natural gas from fracking sites, or energy from wind farms. \nBitcoin is a perfect case study of the inefficiencies of blockchain. Bitcoin's PoW system takes about 10 minutes to add a new block to the blockchain. At that rate, it's estimated that the blockchain network can only manage an estimated seven transactions per second (TPS). Although other cryptocurrencies, such as Ethereum, perform better than Bitcoin, the complex structure of blockchain still limits them. Legacy brand Visa, for context, can process 1,700 TPS. \nSolutions to this issue have been in development for years. There are currently blockchain projects that claim tens of thousands of TPS. Ethereum is rolling out a series of upgrades that include data sampling, binary large objects (BLOBs), and rollups. These improvements are expected to increase network participation, reduce congestion, decrease fees, and increase transaction speeds. \nThe other issue with many blockchains is that each block can only hold so much data. The has been and continues to be one of the most pressing issues for future blockchains' scalability. \nWhile confidentiality on the blockchain network protects users from hacks and preserves privacy, illegal trading and activity on the blockchain network can occur. The most cited example of blockchain being used for illicit transactions is probably the , an online dark web illegal-drug and money laundering marketplace that ran between February 2011 and October 2013, when the FBI shut it down. \nThe allows users to buy and sell illegal goods without being tracked by using the and make illicit purchases in Bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies. This is in stark contrast to U.S. regulations, which require financial service providers to obtain information about their customers when they open an account. They are supposed to verify the identity of each customer and confirm that they do not appear on any list of known or suspected terrorist organizations. \nThis system can be seen as both a pro and a con. It gives anyone access to financial accounts, but allows criminals to transact more easily. Many have argued that the good uses of crypto, like banking the unbanked, outweigh the bad uses of cryptocurrency, especially when most illegal activity is still accomplished through untraceable cash. \nPublic perception of blockchain and cryptocurrencies, in particular, remains uneasy. High-profile collapses of once-trusted cryptocurrency brokers, such as back in 2014, or in November 2022, the persistence of various , and general skepticism towards new technology and its bold promises, all contribute to ongoing public skepticism about a decentralized future. As of 2024, 38% of Americans still say they will never purchase a cryptocurrency.\nMany in the crypto space have expressed concerns about government regulation of cryptocurrencies. Several jurisdictions are tightening control over certain types of crypto and other virtual currencies. However, no regulations have yet been introduced that focus on restricting blockchain uses and development, only certain products created using it. \nAnother significant implication of blockchains is that they require storage. This may not appear to be substantial because we already store lots of information and data. However, as time passes, the growing use will require more storage, especially on blockchains where nodes store the entire chain. \nCurrently, data storage is centralized in large centers. But if the world transitions to blockchain for every industry and use, its exponentially growing size would require more advanced techniques to make storage more efficient, or force participants to continually upgrade their storage. \nThis could become significantly more expensive in terms of both money and physical space needed, as the Bitcoin blockchain itself was over 705 gigabytes as of December 2025, and this blockchain records only Bitcoin transactions. This is small compared to the amount of data stored in large data centers, but a growing number of blockchains will only add to the amount of storage already required for the digital world. \nSimply put, a blockchain is a shared database or ledger. Bits of data are stored in files known as blocks, and each network node has a replica of the entire database. Security is ensured since the majority of nodes will not accept a change if someone tries to edit or delete an entry in one copy of the ledger.\nImagine you typed some information into a document on your computer and sent it through a program that gave you a string of numbers and letters (called hashing, with the string called a hash). You add this hash to the beginning of another document and type information into it. Again, you use the program to create a hash, which you add to the following document.\nEach hash is a representation of the previous document, which creates a chain of encoded documents that cannot be altered without changing the hash. Each document is stored on computers in a network. This network of programs compares each document with the ones they have stored and accepts them as valid based on the hashes they generate. If a document doesn't generate a hash that is a match, that document is rejected by the network.\nA blockchain is a distributed network of files chained together using programs that create hashes, or strings of numbers and letters that represent the information contained in the files. Every network participant is a computer or device that compares these hashes to the ones they generate. If there is a match, the file is kept. If there isn't, the file is rejected.\nWith many practical applications for the technology already being implemented and explored, blockchain is finally making a name for itself because of the demand and popularity of Bitcoin and cryptocurrency. As a buzzword on the tongue of every investor across the globe, blockchain stands to make business and government operations more accurate, efficient, secure, and cheap, with fewer intermediaries. \nAs we head into the third decade of blockchain, it’s no longer a question of if legacy companies will catch on to the technology—it’s a question of when. Today, we see a proliferation of NFTs and the tokenization of assets. Tomorrow, we may see a combination of blockchains, tokens, and artificial intelligence all incorporated into business and consumer solutions. \nDid you know that 82% of Nvidia’s gains between March 2024 and February 2025 happened outside of regular Nasdaq hours?* on 100+ US shares 24 hours a day, meaning you never need to miss out when the markets move. for super-fast execution backed by dedicated support. 74-89% of retail CFD accounts lose money *Data from the Pepperstone platform. \nInvestopedia requires writers to use primary sources to support their work.

      "markdown": "\n\nBitcoin (BTC) is a cryptocurrency designed to act as money and as a form of payment outside the control of any one person, group, or entity. This removes the need for trusted third-party involvement (e.g., a mint or bank) in financial transactions. \nBitcoin was introduced to the public in 2008 by an anonymous developer or group of developers known as Satoshi Nakamoto. It has since become the most well-known and largest cryptocurrency in the world, and its popularity has inspired the development of many other cryptocurrencies. \nRead on to learn more about the cryptocurrency that started it all—the history behind it, how to buy it from , mine it, and what it can be used for. \n  * Bitcoin mining is a competition where computers race to solve a cryptographic puzzle. The first to solve it gets to add the next block of transactions to the blockchain and earns newly minted bitcoins as a reward.\n\n\nThe offers that appear in this table are from partnerships from which Investopedia receives compensation. This compensation may impact how and where listings appear. Investopedia does not include all offers available in the marketplace.\nIn October 2008, Nakamoto announced to the cryptography mailing list at metzdowd.com: \"I've been working on a new electronic cash system that's fully peer-to-peer, with no trusted third party.\" The now-famous white paper published on Bitcoin.org, entitled \"Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System,\" would become the Magna Carta for how Bitcoin operates today. \nOn Jan. 3, 2009, the first Bitcoin block was . Called Block 0, it is also known as the and contains the text: \"The Times 03/Jan/2009 Chancellor on brink of second bailout for banks,\" perhaps proof that the block was mined on or after that date. \nEvery four years, the Bitcoin network the reward miners earn for adding a block. This built-in feature slows the creation of new bitcoins and keeps supply limited—much like digital gold. In 2009, miners earned 50 bitcoins per block. By April 2024, that reward dropped to 3.125, and it will fall again to 1.5625 around mid-2028. This predictable scarcity is one reason many investors see Bitcoin as a hedge against . \nBitcoin, as a form of digital currency, isn't hard to understand. For example, if you own a bitcoin, you can use your cryptocurrency wallet to send smaller portions of that bitcoin as payment for goods or services. By contrast, the way Bitcoin is very complex. \nA blockchain is a distributed ledger, a shared database of information that is chained together via cryptographic techniques. \"Distributed\" means that it is stored on many computers rather than a centralized server location, as is typical of most data storage. \nA block on a is a file that contains a block header, transaction counter, and the transactions recorded in the block. The transaction counter lists the transactions in the block, while the block header is made up of several elements: \n\n\nAs noted, each block contains the hashed information of the previous block. This creates a chain of encrypted blocks (files) that contain information from all previous blocks, going back to the first block of the blockchain. \nBitcoin uses the SHA-256 hashing algorithm to encrypt (hash) the data stored in the blocks on the blockchain. Simply put, transaction data stored in a block is encrypted into a 256-bit (64-digit) hexadecimal number. That number contains all the transaction data and information linked to the blocks before that block. \nWhile the data in a block is encrypted and used in the next block, the block is not inaccessible or non-readable. The hash is used in the next block, then its hash is used in the next, and so on, but all blocks can be read. This ensures that blocks cannot be changed without changing all other blocks and ensures anyone can audit the blockchain.\nIf you don't want to mine Bitcoin, you can buy it using a . Most people will be unable to purchase an entire BTC because of its price, but you can buy portions of one BTC on most exchanges in fiat currency, such as U.S. dollars. For example, you can buy a bitcoin on by creating and funding an account using your bank account, credit card, or debit card. The following video explains more about buying Bitcoin. \nA variety of hardware and software can be used to mine Bitcoin. When the Bitcoin blockchain was first released, it was possible to mine it competitively on a personal computer. However, as it became more popular, more miners joined the network, which lowered the chances of being the one to solve the hash. \nThis is because you're competing with a network of miners that generate around 920 quintillion hashes (as of September 2025) per second. Machines—called Application Specific Integrated Circuits (ASICs) built specifically for mining, can generate more than 400 trillion hashes per second. In contrast, a computer with the latest hardware hashes around 100 megahashes per second (100 million). \nThe first option is to use your existing computer and mining software compatible with Bitcoin software and join a mining pool. Mining pools are groups of miners that combine their computational power to compete with large ASIC mining farms. There are and pools you can join. Two of the most well-known programs are CGMiner and BFGMiner. \nThe second option, if you have the financial means, is to purchase an ASIC miner. You can generally find a new one for around $10,000, but used ones are also sold by miners as they upgrade their systems. There are some significant costs, such as electricity and cooling, to consider if you purchase one or more ASICs. Keep in mind that using one or two ASICs is still no guarantee of rewards, as you're competing with businesses with large mining farms of tens, if not hundreds, of thousands of ASICs. For example, Bitcoin mining firm CleanSpark claims to have 242,222 miners deployed. \nJoining a pool can increase your chances of being rewarded bitcoins, but rewards are significantly decreased because they are shared. When , it's important to find out how it pays out rewards, what any fees might be, and read some mining pool reviews.\nBitcoin was initially designed and released as a peer-to-peer payment method. However, its use has evolved due to its increasing value, competition from other blockchains and cryptocurrencies, and developments on blockchains that process information for the Bitcoin blockchain. \nBrick-and-mortar stores that accept cryptocurrencies will generally display a sign that says \"Bitcoin Accepted Here.\" The transactions can be handled with the requisite hardware terminal or wallet address through QR codes and touchscreen apps. An online business can easily accept bitcoin by adding this payment option to its other online payment options: credit cards, PayPal, etc. \nTo use your Bitcoin, you need to have a . Wallets are your blockchain interface and can hold the private keys to the bitcoins that you own. These keys must be entered when you're conducting a transaction. \nInvestors and speculators became interested in Bitcoin as it grew in popularity. Between 2009 and 2017, emerged that facilitated Bitcoin sales and purchases. Prices began to rise, and demand slowly grew until 2017, when its price broke $1,000. \nAfter reaching about $69,000 in November 2021, Bitcoin's price crashed in 2022. In March 2022, it was as high as $47,454, but by November, it was $15,731. It then recovered in 2023, seeing a price as high as $31,474 before dropping back below $30,000. \nIn early 2024, Bitcoin's price jumped into the mid $40,000s as expectations grew for Bitcoin Spot ETFs' approval. By mid-February 2024, after the ETFs were approved, Bitcoin's price climbed to more than $50,000. In early April 2025, Bitcoin started a bull run, leading to Bitcoin beyond the $100,000 mark by hitting an all-time high of over $124,000 in August 2025. \nFollowing an increase in optimism and price after Donald Trump was re-elected in November 2024, Bitcoin breached $100,000 for the first time on Dec. 5, 2024, after years of arguments for and against its ability to do so by investors and analysts.\nBitcoin prices tend to follow stock market trends because Bitcoin is treated the same way that investors treat other investments. However, Bitcoin price movements are greatly volatile and sometimes are prone to movements of thousands of dollars. Many Bitcoin investors tend to \"trade the news,\" as demonstrated by the fluctuations occurring whenever a significant news event occurs. \nBitcoin had a price of $7,167.52 on Dec. 31, 2019, and a year later, it had appreciated more than 300% to $28,984.98. It continued to surge in the first half of 2021, trading at a record high of $69,000 in November 2021. It then fell over the next few months to hover around $40,000 and rose with increasing speed in 2024 to more than $100,000. In April of 2025, Bitcoin was down almost 25%, but it rallied to more than $115,000 in September 2025. \nAs a result of such price movements, many people purchase Bitcoin for its investment value rather than its ability to act as a . However, the lack of guaranteed value and its digital nature mean its purchase and use carry several inherent risks. \n  * : The continuous battle between cryptocurrency-related projects and regulators makes longevity and liquidity unknown. As of September 2025, Bitcoin is not considered a security by the authorities, but that stance could change in the future.\n  * : Most individuals who own and use Bitcoin have not acquired their tokens through mining operations. Rather, they buy and sell Bitcoin and other digital currencies on popular cryptocurrency exchanges. These exchanges are entirely digital and are at risk from hackers, malware, and operational glitches.\n  * : Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies are not insured by the or the . However, some exchanges provide insurance through third parties. For instance, Gemini and Coinbase offer cryptocurrency insurance, but only for failures in their systems or cybersecurity breaches. Any cash deposits you've made at either exchange might be eligible for \"pass-through\" FDIC coverage. \n  * : As with any investment, Bitcoin values can fluctuate. Indeed, the currency's value has seen wild price swings over its short existence. Subject to high volume buying and selling on exchanges, it is highly sensitive to any news events related to it. \n\n\nAs with any new technology, it has been difficult to regulate Bitcoin. The U.S. administration seeks to impose regulations on cryptocurrency but, at the same time, walks a tightrope in trying not to throttle a growing and economically beneficial industry. \nEnforcement agencies in the U.S. continue to rely on existing securities, commodities, and tax laws, but as of July 2025, SEC Chairman Paul Atkins announced Project Crypto, an initiative to modernize the rules governing cryptocurrencies. While Project Crypto does not imply new regulatory updates, it intends to correct regulatory ambiguity to encourage trading in the U.S. \nInvesting in Bitcoin is very risky, but there is also the possibility of high returns. Prices can move by thousands of dollars per day, and long-term outlooks for the cryptocurrency vary.\nAn amount of Bitcoin worth $1 is worth $1 in U.S. dollars. The value of 1 BTC in U.S. dollars varies by the minute, but on September 23, 2025, it was more than $112,000.\nBitcoin was the first cryptocurrency introduced to the public and was intended to be used as a form of payment outside of legal tender. Since its introduction in 2009, Bitcoin's popularity has surged, and its blockchain uses have expanded. \nThough the process of generating Bitcoin is complex, investing in it is more straightforward. Investors and speculators can buy and sell Bitcoin on . As with any investment, particularly one as volatile as Bitcoin, investors should carefully consider if Bitcoin is the right investment for them. \nDid you know that 82% of Nvidia’s gains between March 2024 and February 2025 happened outside of regular Nasdaq hours?* on 100+ US shares 24 hours a day, meaning you never need to miss out when the markets move. for super-fast execution backed by dedicated support. 74-89% of retail CFD accounts lose money *Data from the Pepperstone platform. \nInvestopedia requires writers to use primary sources to support their work.

      "markdown": "\n\nEthereum is a revolutionary global software platform driven by . Known for its native cryptocurrency, ether (ETH), Ethereum is pivotal in the world of blockchain and decentralized finance. It is designed to be scalable, programmable, secure, and decentralized, allowing anyone to develop secure digital technologies. Ether is utilized to power the blockchain and can also be used for payments across platforms that accept it. \n  * In 2016, Ethereum experienced a significant event known as \"The DAO hack,\" leading to a split that created Ethereum Classic (ETC) after a portion of the community chose to retain the original blockchain.\n\n\nVitalik Buterin, credited with conceiving Ethereum, published a white paper introducing it in 2014. Ethereum was launched in 2015 by Buterin and Joe Lubin, the founder of ConsenSys, a blockchain software company. \nOne notable event in Ethereum's history is the , or split, of Ethereum and Ethereum Classic. In 2016, a group of network participants gained control of the smart contracts used by a project called The DAO to steal more than $50 million worth of ether. \nThe offers that appear in this table are from partnerships from which Investopedia receives compensation. This compensation may impact how and where listings appear. Investopedia does not include all offers available in the marketplace.\nThe raid succeeded partly due to a third-party developer's involvement with the new project. Most of the Ethereum community chose to reverse the theft, approving a new blockchain with a revised history. \nThe Dencun hard fork was activated on March 13, 2024. This hard fork introduced proto-danksharding (named in honor of the proposers, Protolambda and Dankrad Feist) to the Ethereum mainchain. Proto-danksharding is a stepping stone for future upgrades to the Ethereum blockchain. \nEthereum operates on a blockchain, a type of distributed ledger similar to a database. Information is stored in blocks, each containing encoded data from the block before it and the new information. This creates an encoded chain of information that cannot be changed. Throughout the blockchain network, an identical copy of the blockchain is distributed. \nEach cell, or block, is created with new ether tokens awarded to the validator for the work required to validate the information in one block and propose a new one. The ether is assigned to the validator's address. \nThe network's automated programs validate a new block by reaching a consensus on its transaction information. On the Ethereum blockchain, consensus is reached after the data and hash are passed between the consensus layer and the execution layer. Enough validators must demonstrate that they all had the same comparative results, and the block becomes finalized. \nProof-of-stake doesn't require the energy-intensive mining used in proof-of-work for block validation. It uses a finalization protocol called Casper-FFG and the algorithm LMD Ghost, combined into a consensus mechanism called Gasper. Gasper monitors consensus and defines how validators receive rewards for work or are punished for dishonesty or lack of activity. \nSolo validators need to stake 32 ETH to become active. Individuals can stake smaller amounts of ETH, but they are required to join a validation pool and share any rewards. A validator creates a new block and attests that the information is valid in a process called attestation. The block is broadcast to other validators called a committee, which verifies it and votes for its validity. \nDishonest validators face penalties under proof-of-stake. Those who attempt to attack the network are identified by Gasper, which flags the blocks to accept and reject based on the validators' votes. \nDishonest validators are punished by having their staked ETH burned and removed from the network. \"Burning\" is the term for sending crypto to a wallet without private keys, effectively taking it out of circulation. \nEthereum owners use wallets to store their ether keys. A wallet is a digital interface that lets you access your cryptocurrency. Your wallet has an address, which can be thought of as an email address in that it is where users send ether, much like they would an email. \ndoesn't store the ether itself. Your wallet holds you use as you would a password when you initiate a transaction. You receive a private key for each ether you own. This key is essential for accessing your ether—you can't use it without it. That's why you hear so much about securing keys using different . \nEthereum is described by founders and developers as “the world’s programmable blockchain,” positioning itself as a distributed virtual computer on which applications can be developed. The , by contrast, was created only to support the bitcoin cryptocurrency as a payment method. \nThe maximum number of bitcoins that can enter circulation is 21 million. The amount of ETH that can be created is unlimited, although the time it takes to process a block of ETH limits how much can be minted each year. The number of Ethereum coins in circulation as of May 2024 is just over 120 million. \nAnother significant difference between Ethereum and Bitcoin is how the respective networks treat transaction processing fees. These fees, known as gas on the Ethereum network, are paid by the participants in Ethereum transactions and burned by the network. The fees associated with Bitcoin transactions are paid to Bitcoin miners. \nEthereum’s transition to the proof-of-stake protocol, which enabled users to validate transactions and mint new ETH based on their ether holdings, was part of a significant upgrade to the Ethereum platform. However, Ethereum now has two layers. The first layer is the execution layer, where transactions and validations occur. The second layer is the consensus layer, where attestations and the consensus chain are maintained. \nTo address scalability, Ethereum is continuing to develop a scalability solution called \"danksharding.\" Sharding was a planned concept that would allow portions (shards) of the blockchain to be stored on nodes rather than the entire blockchain. However, sharding was replaced with plans for danksharding, where transactions are processed off-chain, rolled up (summarized using data availability sampling), and posted to the main chain via a BLOB (Binary Large OBject). \n\n\nWeb3 is still a concept, but it is generally theorized that it will be powered by Ethereum because many of the applications being developed for the \"future of the internet\" use it.\nEthereum is also being implemented into gaming and virtual reality. is a virtual world that uses the Ethereum blockchain to secure items contained within it. Virtual land, avatars, wearables, buildings, and environments are all tokenized through the blockchain to create ownership. \n(NFTs) gained popularity in 2021. NFTs are tokenized digital items created using Ethereum. Generally speaking, tokenization gives one digital asset an identifying token with a private key. The key gives only the owner access to the token. \nNFTs are being developed for all sorts of assets. For example, sports fans can buy a sports token—also called fan tokens—of their favorite athletes, which can be treated like trading cards. Some of these NFTs are pictures that resemble a trading card, and some of them are videos of a memorable or historic moment in the athlete's career. \nThe applications you may use in the metaverse, such as your wallet, a dApp, or the virtual world and buildings you visit, are likely to have been built on Ethereum.\nHere's how DAOs are generally designed: Imagine that you created a venture capital fund and raised money through fundraising, but you want decision-making to be decentralized and distributions to be automatic and transparent. \nYour DAO could use smart contracts and applications to gather the votes from the fund members, buy into ventures based on the majority of the group's votes, and automatically distribute any returns. The transactions could be viewed by all parties, and there would be no third-party involvement in handling any funds. \nThere are many predictions about ether's price, but they are speculation at best. There are too many factors at work in cryptocurrency valuation to accurately predict prices in one week, let alone several years.\nEthereum is a decentralized blockchain and development platform. It allows developers to build and deploy applications and smart contracts. Ethereum utilizes its native cryptocurrency, ether (ETH), for transactions and incentivizes network participants through proof-of-stake (PoS) validation. \nThe role that cryptocurrency will play in the future is still vague. However, Ethereum appears to have a significant, upcoming role in personal and corporate finance and many aspects of modern life. \nDid you know that 82% of Nvidia’s gains between March 2024 and February 2025 happened outside of regular Nasdaq hours?* on 100+ US shares 24 hours a day, meaning you never need to miss out when the markets move. for super-fast execution backed by dedicated support. 74-89% of retail CFD accounts lose money *Data from the Pepperstone platform. \nInvestopedia requires writers to use primary sources to support their work.

      "markdown": "\n\nA smart contract is a self-executing program that automates the actions required in a blockchain transaction. Once done, these transactions are traceable and cannot be undone. The best way to envision a smart contract is to think of a vending machine—when you insert the correct amount of money and push an item's button, the program (the smart contract) activates the machine to dispense your chosen item. \n\n\nSmart contracts were first proposed in 1994 by Nick Szabo, an American computer scientist who conceptualized a virtual currency called \"Bit Gold\" in 1998, 10 years before Bitcoin was introduced. Szabo is often rumored to be the real Satoshi Nakamoto, the anonymous Bitcoin inventor, which he has denied. \nSzabo defined smart contracts as computerized transaction protocols that execute the terms of a contract. He wanted to extend the functionality of electronic transaction methods, such as POS (points of sale), to the digital realm. \nThe offers that appear in this table are from partnerships from which Investopedia receives compensation. This compensation may impact how and where listings appear. Investopedia does not include all offers available in the marketplace.\nSzabo's paper also suggested contracts for synthetic assets, like combining derivatives and bonds. Szabo wrote, \"These new securities are formed by combining securities (such as bonds) and derivatives (options and futures) in a wide variety of ways. Very complex term structures for payments...can now be built into standardized contracts and traded with low transaction costs, due to computerized analysis of these complex term structures.\" \nSmart contracts don't include legal language or the actual terms of an agreement. They are scripts that contain functions, module imports, and other programming that automate the actions between two parties.\nBecause smart contracts execute agreements, they can be used for many different purposes. One of the simplest uses is ensuring transactions between two parties occur, such as the purchase and delivery of goods. For example, a manufacturer needing raw materials can set up payments using smart contracts, and the supplier can set up shipments. Then, depending on the agreement between the two businesses, the funds could be transferred automatically to the supplier upon shipment or delivery. \nIt's important to understand that the connections between blockchain transactions and real-world transfers are still being developed. For example, if you buy an item with ether from a retailer using a blockchain tied to Ethereum, it still needs human packing and shipping. In this case, a smart contract would likely transfer your cryptocurrency to the retailer and initiate another script that notifies the shipping department of a sale.\n\n\nA basic example of a smart contract is a sale transaction between a consumer and a business. The smart contract could execute the customer's payment and initiate the business's shipment process.\nIt depends on the blockchain and how it is programmed. Generally speaking, smart contracts have state variables (data), functions (what can be done), events (messages in and out), and modifiers (special rules for specific users). Some may have additional elements depending on what they are designed to do.\nSmart contracts are code written into a blockchain that executes the actions two parties agree to outside the chain. By automating these actions, the need for an intermediary or trust between the parties is removed. \nDid you know that 82% of Nvidia’s gains between March 2024 and February 2025 happened outside of regular Nasdaq hours?* on 100+ US shares 24 hours a day, meaning you never need to miss out when the markets move. for super-fast execution backed by dedicated support. 74-89% of retail CFD accounts lose money *Data from the Pepperstone platform. \nInvestopedia requires writers to use primary sources to support their work.

      "markdown": "\n\nAltcoins represent all cryptocurrencies and tokens that are not Bitcoin, with some interpretations excluding Ethereum from this category. They're crafted by developers with unique visions, often using distinct consensus mechanisms. These digital currencies attempt to build on the limitations of Bitcoin or craft new functionalities. While Bitcoin remains the most popular cryptocurrency, altcoins like Ethereum (ETH) and XRP have positioned themselves as pivotal players with distinct roles. Learn what defines altcoins and explore their various types, benefits, and considerations for the future \n\n\n\"Altcoin\" is a combination of the two words \"alternative\" and \"coin.\" The term generally includes all cryptocurrencies and tokens that are not Bitcoin. Altcoins belong to the blockchains for which they were explicitly designed. Many are forks—creating a blockchain from another chain—from Bitcoin and Ethereum. These forks generally have more than one reason for occurring. Most of the time, a group of developers disagrees with others and leaves to make their own coin. \nMany altcoins serve specific purposes within their blockchains, like ether, which pays for transaction fees in Ethereum. Some developers created Bitcoin forks, such as , to compete as a payment method. \nThe offers that appear in this table are from partnerships from which Investopedia receives compensation. This compensation may impact how and where listings appear. Investopedia does not include all offers available in the marketplace.\n, the popular , was created as somewhat of a joke. It was forked from , which itself was forked from Bitcoin in 2011. Whatever the intent behind its creation, it was still designed to be a digital payment method.\nAltcoins aim to overcome the limitations of the cryptocurrencies they derive from or compete against. The first altcoin was Litecoin, forked from the Bitcoin blockchain in 2011. Litecoin uses a different proof-of-work (PoW) consensus mechanism than Bitcoin, called Scrypt (pronounced ess-crypt), which is less energy-intensive and quicker than Bitcoin's SHA-256 PoW consensus mechanism. \nis another altcoin. However, it did not fork from Bitcoin. It was designed by Vitalik Buterin, Dr. Gavin Wood, and a few others to be used in Ethereum, the world's largest blockchain-based virtual machine. Ether (ETH) is used to pay network participants for the transaction validation work their machines do. It is also used as collateral (called staking) for the privilege of becoming a validator and block proposer. \nCryptocurrency trading and use have been marked by since its launch. Stablecoins aim to reduce this overall volatility by pegging value to another asset. This is accomplished by holding assets in reserve. Some of the assets held by stablecoin creators are , precious metals, or investment assets. Price fluctuations for stablecoins are not meant to exceed a very narrow range. \nNotable stablecoins include Tether's , MakerDAO's DAI, and the (USDC). In March 2021, payment processing giant Visa Inc. () announced that it would begin settling some transactions on its network in USDC over the Ethereum , with plans to roll out further settlement solutions. \nSecurity tokens are tokens that represent fundraising efforts or ownership. . Tokenization is the transfer of value from an asset to a token. Any asset can be tokenized, such as real estate or stocks. For this to work, the asset must be transparently secured and held. Otherwise, the tokens are worthless because they wouldn't represent anything. Security tokens are regulated by the Securities and Exchange Commission because they are designed to act as securities. \nIn 2021, the Bitcoin wallet firm Exodus successfully completed a Securities and Exchange Commission-qualified Reg A+ token offering, allowing for $75 million shares of common stock to be converted to tokens on the Algorand blockchain. This historic event was the first digital asset security to offer equity in a United States-based issuer. \nUtility tokens enable services within a network, like purchasing services, paying fees, or redeeming rewards. Filecoin, which is used to buy storage space on a network and secure the information, is an example of a utility token. \nEther (ETH) is also a utility token. It is designed to be used in the and virtual machine to pay for transactions. The former stablecoin USTerra used utility tokens to attempt to maintain its peg to the dollar—which it lost on May 11, 2022—by minting and burning two utility tokens to create downward or upward pressure on its price. \nMany refer to the sharp run-up in this type of altcoins during April and May 2021 as \"meme coin season,\" with hundreds of these cryptocurrencies posting enormous percentage gains based on pure . \nAn initial coin offering (ICO) is the cryptocurrency industry's equivalent of an (IPO). A company looking to raise money to create a new coin, app, or service launches an ICO to raise funds.\nGovernance tokens allow holders certain rights within a blockchain, such as voting for changes to protocols or having a say in the decisions of a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO). Because they are generally native to a private blockchain and used for blockchain purposes, they are utility tokens but have come to be accepted as a separate type because of their purpose. \n\n\n\nLocal banks were also issuing currency, sometimes backed by fictitious reserves. That diversity of currencies and financial instruments parallels the current situation in altcoin markets. Thousands of altcoins exist today, each claiming unique purposes and targeting different markets. \nThe current state of affairs in the altcoin market indicates that it will unlikely consolidate into a single cryptocurrency. However, it is likely that most of the thousands of altcoins listed in crypto markets will not survive. The altcoin market will probably coalesce around a few altcoins—those with strong utility, use cases, and a solid blockchain purpose—which will dominate the markets. \nFor diversification, altcoins often provide a cheaper alternative to Bitcoin in the cryptocurrency market. However, the cryptocurrency market, regardless of the type of coin, is young and volatile. Cryptocurrency is still finding its role in the global economy, so it's best to approach all cryptocurrencies cautiously. \nWhich altcoin will take off in 2024 is anyone's guess. There might not be any changes in the market, or a new one could be introduced that attracts a whirlwind of investors.\nAltcoins are any cryptocurrency that is not Bitcoin (or Ethereum). There are thousands of altcoins on the market, so it is difficult to tell which might be legitimate and which are not. It's best to read all the documentation behind whichever cryptocurrency piques your interest. \nIf there is a purpose for the blockchain and token, it might be worth watching—if not, consider other coins or investments. If you're unsure, talk to a financial advisor familiar with cryptocurrencies to help you decide if they are suitable for your portfolio. \nDid you know that 82% of Nvidia’s gains between March 2024 and February 2025 happened outside of regular Nasdaq hours?* on 100+ US shares 24 hours a day, meaning you never need to miss out when the markets move. for super-fast execution backed by dedicated support. 74-89% of retail CFD accounts lose money *Data from the Pepperstone platform. \nInvestopedia requires writers to use primary sources to support their work.

      "title": "Understanding Decentralized Finance (DeFi): Basics and Functionality",
      "markdown": "\n\n\n\n\n\nDecentralized finance (DeFi) is an emerging financial system using blockchain and cryptocurrencies to enable direct transactions between individuals and businesses. By eliminating intermediaries like banks, DeFi aims to reduce costs and speed up processes, although it's currently in its infancy and presents security challenges. \nIn the United States, the Federal Reserve and Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) define the rules for like banks and brokerages, which consumers rely on to access capital and financial services directly. DeFi challenges this centralized financial system by empowering individuals with peer-to-peer transactions. \n\n\nThrough peer-to-peer financial networks, DeFi uses security protocols, connectivity, software, and hardware advancements. This system eliminates intermediaries like banks and other financial service companies. These companies charge businesses and customers for using their services, which are necessary in the current system because it's the only way to make it work. DeFi uses blockchain technology to reduce the need for these intermediaries. \nA blockchain is a distributed and secured database or ledger. In a blockchain, transactions are recorded in files called blocks and verified through automated processes. If a transaction is verified, the block is closed and encrypted; another block is created with information about the previous block and information about newer transactions. \nThe offers that appear in this table are from partnerships from which Investopedia receives compensation. This compensation may impact how and where listings appear. Investopedia does not include all offers available in the marketplace.\nThe blocks are \"chained\" together through the information in each proceeding block, giving it the name . Information in previous blocks cannot be changed without affecting the following blocks, so blockchains are generally very secure if their networks are large and fast enough. This concept, along with other security protocols, provides the secure nature of a blockchain. \nUsing applications called wallets that can send information to a blockchain, individuals hold private keys to tokens or cryptocurrencies that act like passwords. These keys give them access to virtual tokens that represent value. Ownership of the tokens is transferred by 'sending' an amount to another entity via a wallet, whose wallet, in turn, generates a different private key for them. This secures their ownership of the token, and the blockchain design prevents the transfer from being reversed. \nDeFi applications are designed to communicate with a blockchain, allowing people to use their money for purchases, loans, gifts, trading, or any other way they want without a third party. These applications are programs installed on a device like a personal computer, tablet, or smartphone that make it easier to use. Without the applications, DeFi would still exist, but users would need to be comfortable and familiar with using the command line or terminal in the operating system that runs their device. \nDeFi applications provide an interface that automates transactions between users by giving them financial options to choose from. For example, if you want to make a loan to someone and charge them interest, you can select the option on the interface and enter terms like interest or collateral. If you need a loan, you can search for providers, which could range from a bank to an individual who could lend you some cryptocurrency after you agree on terms. \nSome applications let you enter parameters for the services you're looking for and match you with another user. Because the blockchain is a global network, you can give or receive financial services to or from anywhere in the world. \nDecentralized finance does not provide full anonymity. Transactions do not include an individual's name but are traceable by anyone with the knowledge to do so. This includes governments and law enforcement, which, at times, are necessary for protecting an individual's financial interests.\n  * : published on a blockchain and records of completed transactions are available for anyone to review but do not reveal your identity. Blockchains are generally immutable, meaning they cannot be altered.\n\n\nunder DeFi doesn't mean there won't be any interest and fees. However, it does mean that you'll have many more options since the lender can be anywhere and anyone in the world.\n1. Research activities in DeFi that interest you.2. Choose a suitable digital wallet for DeFi applications.3. Purchase cryptocurrency through a reputable exchange.4. Identify a DeFi app that suits your needs, such as borrowing or yield farming.5. Begin by integrating your cryptocurrency with the selected app. \nDeFi is an all-inclusive term for any application that uses blockchain and cryptocurrency techniques or technology to offer financial services. Some of these applications can provide anything from basic services like savings accounts to more advances services like providing liquidity to businesses or investors. One of the more notable DeFi service providers is Aave, which is a \"decentralized non-custodial liquidity market protocol\" that allows anyone to participate as a liquidity supplier or borrower. \nDecentralized finance, originally conceived of as a way to bring financial services like loans and banking to , has morphed into an industry where you can take part in many different sectors or endeavors. Here are a few of the most popular: \n  * : Liquidity is the ability to sell assets quickly, a problem many cryptocurrency users have encountered. Liquidity providers are generally pools where users place funds so exchanges can provide selling opportunities for their users. \n  * There are hundreds of defi apps available that provide lending. Generally, they operate the same way as a liquidity pool, where users lock their funds in a pool and let others borrow them, receiving interest on their loans—called yield farming. Many provide flash loans, where no collateral is required from the borrower.\n  * : Everyday, millions of dollars in cryptocurrency are used in DeFi gambling and prediction apps like Polymarket, ZKasino, Horse Racing Slot Keno Roulett, Azuro, and JuicyBet. Prediction markets are platforms that let you place bets on the outcome of nearly any event. \n\n\nJust like other blockchain- and cryptocurrency-related projects, businesses, and activities, decentralized finance is subject to considerable hype and misinformation, hoping to attract users and their money. Cryptocurrency, blockchain, and all technologies associated with them are also subject to extreme price volatility. \nThere is a considerable amount of money flowing through cryptocurrency exchanges, but it isn't nearly as much as you might be led to believe. Most people still use the traditional financial systems we are all used to. For example, of all money is tied up in cryptocurrency and decentralized finance—a very small figure that should encourage you to do your research to learn if using or investing in DeFi apps, platforms, and cryptocurrency is worth it. \nA crypto-winter is a period where crypto prices continuously move down and then stay down—sometimes tens of thousands of dollars. The last one occurred between 2022 and 2023. Prices had been rising significantly before 2022 as investors turned to anything they could find following the initial outbreak of COVID-19 and the ensuing pandemic. During that time, they discovered Bitcoin was not only holding value; it was increasing as well—but this was most likely due to their own self-fulfilling prophecies and hype as they drove the price increases themselves. \nBut toward the end of 2022, prices began declining and stayed there. Billions of dollars were lost during this time. During this period, there were no rumors of substance or any regulatory developments (in the U.S.) beyond a perceived campaign of persecution orchestrated by the Securities and Exchange Commission. However, when rumors began circulating about a Spot Bitcoin ETF approval in October 2023, the hyping began again, and prices rose. When the approval of 11 Bitcoin Spot ETFs was announced in January 2024, prices climbed steadily for a few months (supposedly ending the winter) until a sideways—yet volatile—market emerged again in March 2024. \nDeFi might be just what you're looking for regarding your finances. However, it might not—the decentralized finance industry is still in its infancy and evolving, making it somewhat of a gamble for most people. \nThe low amount of actual money invested in cryptocurrency and the effects that hype has on prices should make you consider whether investing in decentralized finance is worth it. If you have money you can afford to lose, the space can be very profitable—but the losses can be just as significant. \nIf you don't have money to lose and are looking for ways to fund your retirement or grow your portfolio or net worth over time, defi and cryptocurrency should be the last investment you should consider. They are still too new and volatile to risk your future on. \nDecentralized finance is constantly evolving. It is unregulated, and its ecosystem is vulnerable to faulty programming, hacks, and scams. For example, one of the main ways hackers and thieves steal cryptocurrency is through weaknesses in DeFi applications. \nLaws have not yet caught up with advances in technology. Most current laws were crafted based on the idea of separate financial jurisdictions, each with its own set of laws and rules. DeFi’s borderless transaction ability presents essential questions for this type of regulation. For example: \nYes, there are ways to make money using DeFi, such as yield farming or providing liquidity. However, there are risks involved, so it pays to do your research before locking money into DeFi.\nDeFi is still in its infancy, with hacks and thefts common. There are many people using it to make money and transact, but in its current state it is not yet as safe as traditional finance methods.\nDecentralized finance is a blanket term for the global system of blockchains and applications that are being developed to allow people to transact directly with each other using cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin. Bitcoin is a cryptocurrency that can be used in DeFi.\nDecentralized finance (DeFi) is a groundbreaking alternative to traditional financial systems, aiming to reduce reliance on centralized institutions and promote peer-to-peer transactions using blockchain technology. While promising, DeFi remains in its infancy, presenting vulnerabilities to hacks and regulatory challenges. Potential users should approach cautiously, keeping in mind its risks and the minor proportion of financial capital currently in DeFi. Research and a thorough understanding of DeFi applications can empower individuals to navigate this nascent field effectively. Although traditional financial systems pose challenges, they are well-established and likely to adapt and participate in blockchain-based financial innovations. \nCould you be getting more from your CFD trading? with razor-sharp spreads, low commission and deep liquidity.

      "title": "Non-Fungible Token (NFT): What It Means and How It Works",
      "markdown": "\n\nNon-fungible tokens (NFTs) are assets like artworks, digital content, or videos that have been tokenized via a blockchain. Tokens are unique identification codes created from metadata via an encryption function. These tokens are then stored on a digital ledger, while the assets themselves are stored in other places. The connection between the token and the asset is what makes them unique. \nNFTs can be traded and exchanged for money, cryptocurrencies, or other NFTs—it all depends on the value the market and owners have placed on them. For instance, you could draw a smiley face on a banana, take a picture of it (with metadata attached), and tokenize it on a blockchain. Whoever has the private keys to that token owns whatever rights you have assigned to it. \nCryptocurrencies share similarities with NFTs in that both are secured on blockchain networks. The key difference is that cryptocurrencies are , meaning there's no significant difference between one Bitcoin and another; no two NFTs are identical. While Crypto.com offers NFTs, most do not. NFTs can be purchased through platforms such as OpenSea or Magic Eden. \nNFTs were created long before they became popular in the mainstream. The first NFT reportedly sold was \"Quantum.\" It was designed and tokenized by Kevin McKoy in 2014 on one blockchain (Namecoin), later minted on Ethereum, and sold in 2021. \nThe offers that appear in this table are from partnerships from which Investopedia receives compensation. This compensation may impact how and where listings appear. Investopedia does not include all offers available in the marketplace.\nMost NFTs on the Ethereum blockchain are built following the ERC-721 standard, which dictates the transfer of ownership and how transactions are confirmed, along with how applications handle safe transfers (among other requirements). Approved six months after ERC-721, the ERC-1155 standard lets multiple NFTs share a single contract, reducing transaction costs. \nOne of the earliest popular NFTs was CryptoKitties, a digital collectible game launched in November 2017. Each is a digital representation of a cat with unique \"cattributes\" determined from the cat's unique identifier on the Ethereum blockchain. Some features are rarer than others, leading collectors to place higher prices on them. They \"reproduce\" among themselves and create new offspring with other attributes and valuations compared to their \"parents.\" \nAlso launched in 2017, Decentraland is a blockchain-based open world where participants can buy and sell virtual . Each \"parcel\" of Decentraland is associated with its geographical coordinates, with some plots commanding a higher value because of their premium location. \nthrough a process called minting, in which the asset's information is encrypted and recorded on a blockchain. At a high level, the minting process entails a new block being created, NFT information being validated by a validator, and the block being closed. This minting process often entails incorporating smart contracts that assign ownership and manage NFT transfers. \nAs tokens are minted, they are assigned a unique identifier directly linked to one blockchain address. Each token has an owner, and the ownership information (i.e., the address in which the minted token resides) is publicly available. Even if 5,000 NFTs of the same exact item are minted (similar to general admission tickets to a movie), each token has a unique identifier and can be distinguished from the others. \nMany blockchains can create NFTs, but they might be called something different. For instance, they are called Ordinals on the Bitcoin blockchain. Like an Ethereum-based NFT, a can be bought, sold, and traded. The difference is Ethereum creates tokens for the asset, while Ordinals have serial numbers (called identifiers) assigned to satoshis—the smallest bitcoin denomination. \nLike physical money, cryptocurrencies are usually from a financial perspective, meaning that they can be traded or exchanged, one for another. For example, one is always equal in value to another bitcoin on a given exchange, similar to how every dollar bill of U.S. currency has an implicit exchange value of $1. This fungibility characteristic makes cryptocurrencies suitable as a secure medium of transaction in the digital economy. \nFor this reason, NFTs shift the crypto paradigm by making each token unique and irreplaceable, making it impossible for one non-fungible token to be \"equal\" to another. They are digital representations of assets and have been likened to digital passports because each token contains a unique, non-transferable identity to distinguish it from other tokens. They are also extensible, meaning you can combine one NFT with another to create a third, unique NFT—the cryptocurrency industry calls this \"breeding.\" \nMuch of the earlier market for NFTs was centered around digital art and , but it has evolved into much more. For instance, the popular NFT marketplace OpenSea has several NFT categories: \n  * : Photographers can tokenize their work and offer total or partial ownership. For example, OpenSea user erubes1 has an \"Ocean Intersection\" collection of ocean and surfing photos with several sales and owners. \n  * NFTs with the main purpose to be used as a social media profile picture or avatar. Popular PFPs include Bored Ape Yacht Club and World of Women (WoW).\n\n\nPerhaps the most apparent benefit of NFTs is . Tokenizing a physical asset can streamline sales processes and remove intermediaries. NFTs representing digital or physical artwork on a blockchain can eliminate the need for agents and allow sellers to connect directly with their target audiences (assuming the artists know how to host their NFTs securely). \nNFTs can also streamline investing. For example, in 2019, consulting firm Ernst & Young developed an NFT solution for one of its fine wine investors, storing wine in a secure environment and using NFTs to protect provenance. \ncan also be tokenized by being parceled into multiple sections, each containing different characteristics. For instance, one section might be on a lakeside, while another is closer to the forest. Depending on its features, each piece of land could be unique, priced differently, and represented by an NFT. Real estate trading, a complex and bureaucratic affair, could then be simplified by incorporating relevant metadata into a unique NFT associated with only the corresponding portion of the property. \nNFTs can represent ownership in a business, much like stocks—in fact, stock ownership is already tracked via ledgers that contain information such as the stockholder's name, date of issuance, certificate number, and the number of shares. A blockchain is a distributed and secured ledger, so issuing NFTs to represent shares serves the same purpose as issuing stocks. The main advantage of using NFTs and blockchain instead of a stock ledger is that smart contracts can automate ownership transfer—once an NFT share is sold, the blockchain can take care of everything else. \nNFTs can also democratize investing by fractionalizing physical assets. Fractionalized ownership through tokenization can extend to many assets. For instance, a painting does not always need a single owner—tokenization allows multiple people to purchase a share of it, transferring ownership of a fraction of the physical painting to them. \nThe token represents ownership via hashed metadata and matching key pairs generated by your wallet. The image, video, music, or other digitized item can be copied and circulated without your permission using various techniques. It's very easy to copy an image by right-clicking on it and saving it. The person who does this to a tokenized digital asset is pirating the asset because there is established ownership. However, it is up to the owner to locate and file charges against the multitude of people who might do this. \nNon-fungible tokens are also very limited by their liquidity. They attract a specific audience of collectors or buyers because they are much more specific than cryptocurrencies. If you find yourself holding an NFT you no longer want, it might be difficult to find a buyer if that type is no longer popular. \nEven if you don't use cryptocurrency or blockchain technology, you may have encountered NFTs on social media. Platforms like Reddit and X have integrated NFTs as their profile pictures, and Instagram has also experimented with digital collectibles. \nIt depends on what the NFT represents. If it is tokenized real estate, the NFT would be exchanged for the property's market value, which, if it has appreciated, would generate a return for the seller. If the NFT were an image of a monkey in a hat, it would depend on that specific token's market value. If its price had increased since it was last purchased, a seller would earn a profit.\nNon-fungible tokens can be valuable to the right person. To an investor, they might appreciate in value. To a collector, they might just be a collection they want to keep. Another person might only want to own it, yet another might consider it memorabilia of a specific moment they treasure.\nA non-fungible token (NFT) is the opposite of a fungible token, which describes the interchangeability of a token. For example, say you had three notes with identical smiley faces drawn on them. When you tokenize one of them, that note becomes distinguishable from the others—it is non-fungible. The other two notes are indistinguishable, so they can each take the place of the other.\nThe idea behind NFTs is to create tokens that represent ownership. The token could represent anything from a digital image to partial ownership of an interstellar spaceship. In theory, because they are created using blockchain technology, they are immutable, secure, and don't require the intervention of third parties.\nNon-fungible tokens are an evolution of the cryptocurrency concept. Modern finance systems consist of sophisticated trading and loan systems for different asset types, from real estate to lending contracts to artwork. By enabling digital representations of assets, NFTs are a step forward in the reinvention of this infrastructure. \nTo be sure, the idea of digital representations of physical assets is not novel, nor is the use of unique identification. However, when these concepts are combined with the benefits of a tamper-resistant blockchain with smart contracts and automation, they become a potent force for change. \n_The comments, opinions, and analyses expressed on Investopedia are for informational purposes only.

      "title": "Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO): Definition, Purpose, and Example",
      "markdown": "A decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) is an organizational structure with no central governing body. DAOs, which were popularized by enthusiasts. have members who share a common goal of acting in the community's best interests. They are completely and make decisions using a bottom-up management approach. \n\n\nDigital currencies are , so they aren't controlled by one institution like a government or . Rather, they are divided among different computers, networks, and nodes. This inspired a group of developers, and they developed the idea for a decentralized autonomous organization in 2016. It was meant to promote oversight and management like a corporation but under a collective group of leaders and participants that acts as the governing body. \nDAOs rely on smart contracts to function. These scripts generally automate the group's decisions when the required number of votes is reached. If a proposal fails, the smart contract doesn't execute anything. Imagine a governed by a DAO where some members wanted to change how a blockchain's tokenomics worked. This could be an increase in the circulating supply of coins, burning some reserve tokens, or issuing rewards to existing token holders. \nMembers could call for a vote on a proposal, which would be broadcast to voting members. The smart contract would tally the vote. This may be automated, as it would require altering the blockchain's coding. Regardless, the outcome would determine the direction the blockchain would take. If the vote was about spending tokens from the treasury on a certain project, the smart contract could automate the transfer of tokens to the entities working on the project. \nThe offers that appear in this table are from partnerships from which Investopedia receives compensation. This compensation may impact how and where listings appear. Investopedia does not include all offers available in the marketplace.\nIn 2021, ConstitutionDAO was formed to attempt to buy a copy of the U.S. Constitution. Though the DAO failed to acquire the asset, it proved that a collection of like-minded individuals could form and pursue such endeavors.\nVoting power is often distributed across users based on the number of tokens they hold. For example, one user with 100 tokens of the DAO could have twice the weight of voting power over a user with 50 tokens. \nThe theory is that users with a larger investment in the DAO are incentivized to act in good faith. For instance, imagine that a DAO member owns a majority of the organization's voting power or a majority of the tokens. This user could act in bad faith; however, if the DAO is programmed to penalize bad actors, the user will jeopardize the value of their holdings. \nDAOs often have treasuries that house tokens that can be issued in exchange for fiat. Members can vote on how to use those funds. For example, some DAOs that are intent on acquiring rare can vote on whether to relinquish treasury funds in exchange for assets. \n  * Decisions impacting the organization are made by a collection of individuals as opposed to a central authority. Instead of relying on the actions of one individual (CEO) or a small collection of individuals (), a DAO can decentralize authority across a vastly larger range of users.\n  * Individuals within an entity may feel more empowered and connected when they have a direct say and voting power on all matters. These individuals may not have strong voting power, but a DAO encourages holders to cast votes, burn tokens, or use their tokens in ways they think are best for the entity.\n  * Within a DAO, votes are cast via blockchain and made publicly viewable. This requires users to act in ways they feel are best, as their votes and decisions are publicly viewable. This incentivizes actions that will benefit voters' reputations and discourages acts against the community.\n  * The DAO concept can encourage people from all over the world to seamlessly come together to build a single vision. With just an internet connection, token holders can interact with other owners wherever they may live. \n\n\n  * If a public company is guided by a CEO, a single vote may be needed to decide a specific action or course for the company to take. In a DAO, every user can vote. This might require a much longer voting period, especially considering time zones and priorities outside the DAO.\n  * A DAO must educate members about pending activities. It's much easier for a single CEO to make decisions on company developments, as DAO token holders may have varying educational backgrounds, understanding of initiatives, incentives, or accessibility to resources. While DAOs bring a diverse group of people together, it's often challenging for those people to learn how to grow, strategize, and communicate.\n  * DAOs run a major risk of being inefficient. Because of the time needed to educate voters, communicate initiatives, explain strategies, and onboard new members, it is easy for a DAO to spend much more time discussing change than implementing it. A DAO may get bogged down in trivial, administrative tasks due to the nature of needing to coordinate many more individuals.\n  * A DAO requires significant technical expertise to implement. Without it, voting and decision-making may be compromised. Trust may be broken, and users may leave the entity if they can't rely on its structure. Even if multi-sig or are used, DAOs can be exploited, treasury reserves stolen, and vaults emptied.\n\n\nThe DAO was an organization designed to act as a form of fund based on open-source code without a typical management structure or board of directors. The DAO was built using the network. \nThe DAO launched in late April 2016 thanks to a month-long crowd sale of tokens that raised more than $150 million in funds. At the time, the launch was the largest campaign ever recorded. \nBy May 2016, The DAO held a large percentage of ether tokens (up to 14% of the total circulating amount), according to reporting by At roughly the same time, a paper was published that addressed several potential security vulnerabilities, cautioning investors from voting on future investment projects until those issues had been resolved. \nIn June 2016, hackers attacked The DAO based on these vulnerabilities. The hackers accessed 3.6 million ETH, worth about $50 million at the time. This prompted a massive and contentious argument among DAO investors, with some individuals suggesting various ways of addressing the hack and others calling for The DAO to be permanently disbanded. \nAccording to IEEE Spectrum, the DAO was vulnerable to programming errors and attack vectors. The fact that the organization was charting new territory regarding regulation and corporate law likely did not make the process any easier. The ramifications of the organization's structure were potentially numerous: investors were concerned that they would be held liable for actions taken by The DAO as a broader organization. \nThe DAO also operated in murky territory regarding whether or not it was selling securities. Further, there were long-standing issues regarding how The DAO would function in the real world. and contractors alike needed to convert ETH into fiat currencies, which could have impacted the value of ether. \nFollowing the contentious argument over The DAO's future and the massive hacking incident earlier in the summer, by the fall of 2016, several prominent , such as Kraken, de-listed The DAO's token, marking the effective end for The DAO as it was initially envisioned. \nA DAO is a decentralized autonomous organization, a type of bottom-up entity structure with no central authority. Members of a DAO own DAO-issued tokens and can vote on initiatives for the entity. Smart contracts are implemented for the DAO, and the code governing many DAOs' operations is open-source or publicly auditable.\nA DAO is an organization of people that uses blockchain technology to improve traditional top-down management structures. Instead of relying on a single individual or a small collection of individuals to guide the entity's direction, a DAO intends to give every member a voice, vote, and opportunity to propose initiatives.\nDecentralized autonomous organizations are entities using blockchains and tokens to democratize governance to those with voting rights. Members of DAOs decide the direction of the organization and govern how it is run. The intent behind DAOs is to remove centralized control and give decision-making abilities to all users rather than leaving it up to a centralized group or person. \nDid you know that 82% of Nvidia’s gains between March 2024 and February 2025 happened outside of regular Nasdaq hours?* on 100+ US shares 24 hours a day, meaning you never need to miss out when the markets move. for super-fast execution backed by dedicated support. 74-89% of retail CFD accounts lose money *Data from the Pepperstone platform. \nInvestopedia requires writers to use primary sources to support their work.

      "title": "Decentralized Applications (dApps): What They Are, Uses, and Benefits",
      "markdown": "\n\nDecentralized applications (dApps) operate across or (P2P) networks, allowing them to function without a single controlling authority. Built often on Ethereum, these applications serve various purposes like finance, gaming, and social media while safeguarding privacy and resisting censorship. \n\n\nA web app such as Uber or X (formerly Twitter) runs on a computer system that is owned and operated by a company with authority over the app and its workings. No matter how many users there are, the backend is controlled by the company. \nDApps operate a bit differently. They run on a P2P or a blockchain network. For example, BitTorrent, Tor, and Popcorn Time are applications that run on computers that are part of a P2P network, which allows multiple participants to consume, feed, or seed content. \nDApps are similar but run on a blockchain network in a public, , decentralized environment. They are free from control and interference by any single authority. For example, a developer can create an X-like dApp and put it on a blockchain where any user can publish messages. Once posted, no one except the message originator can delete the messages. \nA centralized app has a single owner. The application software for a centralized app resides on one or more servers controlled by the owner. Users interact with the app by downloading a copy of it and then sending and receiving data back and forth from the company's server. \nThe offers that appear in this table are from partnerships from which Investopedia receives compensation. This compensation may impact how and where listings appear. Investopedia does not include all offers available in the marketplace.\nA decentralized app operates on a blockchain or peer-to-peer network of computers. Users engage in transactions directly with one another rather than relying on a central authority to facilitate them. The dApp might be free, or the user might need to pay the developer in to download and use the program's source code. The source code nearly always uses smart contracts, which complete transactions between people. Smart contracts remove the need to trust that the other party will execute their part of a transaction. The apps also rely on blockchain protocols that hide personal information. \nBecause dApps operate on decentralized networks, there is no need for an intermediary. This approach can reduce costs, enhance efficiency, and improve accessibility. For example, instead of having to rely on a bank, imagine having nearly 100% control of every aspect of your finances. This can have major implications for many industries, especially the financial sector. \nBy using blockchain technology, dApps can enhance security in various business and personal processes. Blockchains make data immutable by leveraging cryptographic techniques and distributed automated consensus. Because the ledger is shared and compared across all users, data cannot be altered. \nDApps are accessible to anyone with an internet connection. It doesn't matter where you live—all you need is internet access. This global accessibility democratizes access to many different types of services, , and information. \nBlockchain-based dApps maintain transparent records of transactions, meaning users can verify the integrity of data without relying on centralized authorities. This transparency is critical for distributed and anonymous networks because users need to know the system is trustworthy. \nDApps have also been developed to enable secure, blockchain-based voting and governance. They can even be integrated into web browsers to function as plugins that help serve ads, track user behavior, or solicit crypto donations. \n\n\nPhishing attacks, which use fake websites or emails to trick people into revealing sensitive information, have been seen on dApps. In addition, some dApps have been used to distribute malware or viruses, which can compromise users' devices and steal sensitive information. \nUsers should be cautious and do their due diligence when interacting with dApps, as the decentralized nature of these applications can make it difficult to track or hold perpetrators accountable. \nIndustry analytics group DappRadar found that 312 hacks and vulnerabilities affected dApps in 2022, leading to losses of around $48 billion. Financial losses decreased by 96% to $1.9 billion in 2023, but the frequency with which hacks and exploits were used increased by 17.3%. In the first quarter of 2024, losses increased by 9% to $407 million compared to Q1 2023's $373 million.\nSupporters of free speech argue that dApps can become alternative social media platforms. A decentralized social media platform is resistant to censorship because no single participant on the blockchain can delete or block messages. \nEthereum provides a flexible platform that lets developers focus on finding innovative uses for digital applications. This could enable the rapid deployment of dApps in several industries, including banking and finance, gaming, social media, and online shopping. \nDApps are still in the early stages, so they are experimental and prone to certain problems and unknowns. There are questions about whether these apps can scale effectively. Also, there are concerns that too many applications requiring computational resources will overload a network, causing congestion. \nThe ability to develop a user-friendly interface is another concern. Most apps developed by traditional centralized institutions have an ease-of-use expectation that encourages users to use and interact with the app. Getting people to transition to dApps will require developers to create an and level of performance that rivals popular and established programs. \nBecause they are decentralized, dApps are not subject to the oversight and auditing most centralized applications are exposed to. If the application's programming is rushed, unaudited, or sloppy, hackers will find it easy to break into it. \nAfter deployment, a dApp often requires updates to enhance features or fix bugs and security issues. According to Ethereum, it can be challenging for developers to update dApps because the data and code published to the blockchain are hard to modify. \nOne of the primary challenges regulators face with dApps is their decentralized nature. Traditional regulatory considerations are usually based on a specific location; since dApps are not centralized, it's tougher to regulate activity based on where transactions occur. \nConsider the General Data Protection Regulation () and its implementation within the European Union. DApp providers that serve the EU audience must comply with GDPR requirements, regardless of their home jurisdiction. \nIn December 2023, a European subnet of the Internet Computer Protocol (ICP, a blockchain DAO) was launched that provides an infrastructure and set of tools developers can use to create compliant dApps. If using the ICP becomes the standard way of ensuring compliance, the apps lose their decentralized standing because the ICP is centralized—nodes must be voted in by the DAO and can only be located in the EU. \nSome dApps issue tokens or conduct token sales to raise money. This may raise regulatory concerns as authorities work to protect investors—it is viewed by regulators as an unregistered securities issuance. Similarly, financial dApps like decentralized exchanges or lending platforms must follow regulations. \nThere is also a consumer protection element even if the user is not exchanging money or goods. This includes . Agreeing to the transactions via signature puts users at risk; platforms such as MetaMask warn users to be aware that they could lose funds if they're unaware of what they agree to when using dApps. \nOne popular example of a dApp is CryptoKitties. CryptoKitties is a blockchain-based virtual game that allows players to adopt, raise, and trade virtual cats. The game is one of the world’s first forms of interactive blockchain dApps. \nEach CryptoKitty is unique, owned by the user, and validated through the blockchain. Like other types of tradeable assets, its value can appreciate or depreciate based on the market. CryptoKitties are considered “crypto collectibles” because each digital pet is one-of-a-kind and verified on a blockchain. \nAnother example is , a decentralized exchange protocol built on Ethereum. Uniswap enables users to trade directly with each other without needing an intermediary, like a bank or broker. This dApp uses automated smart contracts to create liquidity pools that facilitate trades. Users can trade their tokens directly from their wallets, providing a seamless and secure trading experience. Again, the existence of Uniswap is made possible by the decentralized nature of the application. \nDecentralized applications (dApps) are revolutionizing digital interactions by running on blockchain networks instead of centralized servers. These open-source programs enhance user privacy, resist censorship, and enable direct peer-to-peer exchanges without intermediaries. While promising significant disruption in sectors like finance, gaming, and social media, dApps also face challenges in scalability, user interface design, and security. Users must exercise caution, as the decentralized nature of dApps complicates regulatory oversight, potentially exposing them to higher risks. \nCould you be getting more from your CFD trading? with razor-sharp spreads, low commission and deep liquidity.

When a correct solution is reached, a reward in the form of bitcoin and fees for the work done is given to the miner(s) who reached the solution first. \nThis reward process continues until . Once that number is reached, the mining process is expected to cease, and Bitcoin miners will be rewarded through fees for validating Bitcoin transactions. However, Bitcoin will still be readily available through . \nHere's a simplified example of the mining process. Say you ask friends to guess a number between 1 and 100. Your friends don't have to guess the exact number; they just have to be the first to guess a number less than or equal to your number. If you think of the number 19 and a friend comes up with 21, another 55, and yet another 83, they lose because they all guessed more than 19. But they get to guess again, and the next guesses are 16, 41, and 67. The one who guessed 16 wins because they were first to guess a number less than or equal to 19. \nIn this case, the number you chose, 19, represents the target hash the Bitcoin network creates for a block, and the random guesses from your friends are the guesses from the miners. \nThe offers that appear in this table are from partnerships from which Investopedia receives compensation.

It uses cryptography, encryption, distributed computing, and technology to verify and secure transactions. Here are the main ideas behind mining that make it work. \nAt the heart of Bitcoin mining is . A hash is a 64-character code created by running a block’s data through the SHA-256 algorithm. This part of the process takes little time to complete—in fact, you can generate a hash in under a second, pasting some content into an online SHA256 hash generator. This is the encryption method used by Bitcoin to create a block hash. However, decrypting that hash back to the content you pasted is the difficult part: a 64-digit hash can take centuries to decode with modern hardware. \nIf you change one value in that content, like switching one \"t\" to an \"a,\" the hash changes. Here is the same paragraph, but the first word is misspelled as \"Aa\" instead of \"At\": \nThis is the number called the block hash, which is used in the next block's header as part of the information run through encryption. Each block uses the previous block's hash, which acts to chain them together. This is where the term came from. \nBitcoin mining requires the mining program to generate a hash and append another number to it called the nonce, or \"number used once.\" When a miner begins, it always starts this number at zero. The nonce changes by one every attempt—first, it's 0, then 1, 2, 3, and so on. If the hash and nonce generated by the miner are more than the target hash set by the network, the attempt fails, and the miner tries again. Once the nonce reaches about 4.5 billion, it rolls over like an odometer, using another counter called the extra nonce from another field. \nEvery miner on the network does this until a hash and nonce combination is created that is less than or equal to the target hash. The first to reach that target has their proposed block added to the chain, receives the reward and fees, and a new block is opened. Once that block fills up with information (about one megabyte), it is closed, encrypted, and mined. \nis made up of thousands of devices that mine 24 hours per day. Because the mining reward goes to the first to solve the problem, they are all competing. This competition led miners to create pools to gain an advantage over other miners because they needed more computational power to increase their chances of winning. \nis what's called ; the work done to generate the winning hash is viewed as proof that the miner validated the transactions in the block, so it's called PoW. \nPoW is also sometimes called a consensus mechanism, but PoW is only part of the consensus. This is achieved after the miner adds the block to the blockchain, and the rest of the network validates it using the hashes (reaching consensus). This doesn't require much energy or computational power because each mining node also does this while mining the latest block. As new blocks are added, the network confirms them. \nEach block contains the previous block's hash, so when the next block's hash is generated, the previous block's hash is included. Remember that if even one character changes, the hash completely changes, and the hash of each following block will change. \nWhen you mine a block and close it, it isn't yet confirmed. The block isn't considered confirmed until five blocks later, when it has gone through six total validations. With that said, it is possible to alter information in a block before reaching six validations, but it is highly unlikely because the person or group attempting to make the change must own a majority of the nodes to . \nThe reward for successfully validating a block is Bitcoin. In 2009, you'd receive 50 coins for mining a block. But the block every 210,000 blocks (roughly every four years). Starting in 2012, the reward declined to 25, then 12.5 in 2016, then 6.25 in 2020. At Bitcoin's last halving event in April 2024, the reward changed to 3.125. The next halving event is not expected until 2028, halving the amount to 1.5625 BTC. \nAnother incentive for Bitcoin miners to participate in the process is transaction fees. In addition to rewards, miners also receive fees from any transactions contained in that block. When Bitcoin reaches its planned limit of 21 million (), miners will be rewarded with fees for processing transactions that network users will pay. These fees ensure that miners still have the incentive to mine and keep the blockchain network going. The idea is that competition for these fees will cause them to remain low after halving events are finished. \nMining difficulty is how much work it takes to generate a number less than the target hash. Mining difficulty changes every 2,016 blocks or approximately every two weeks. The next difficulty level depends on how efficient miners were in the preceding cycle and how many miners are participating. \nBitcoin's network increases and decreases the hash rate (the amount of computing power) needed to mine the cryptocurrency. The more miners there are competing for a solution, the more difficult the problem will become. If computational power is taken off the blockchain network, the difficulty adjusts downward to make mining easier. This is done to keep block times averaging about 10 minutes. \nThe difficulty level for mining on Sept. 24, 2025, was 142.34 trillion. That is, the chances of a computer producing a hash below the target are 1 in 142.34 trillion. To put that in perspective, you are about 292,201,338 times more likely to win the Powerball jackpot with a single ticket than you are to generate the correct hash on a single try. \n  * : This is the power that runs your mining systems 24/7. Mining can run up a substantial bill. The process (network-wide) consumes as much electricity as certain countries. It's also important to of cooling the area where your mining systems are. They produce a lot of heat; the more units you have, the more cooling will be required. Air conditioning costs further increase the electricity bill. \n  * : Contrary to the popular narrative, desktop computers and regular gaming systems can be used to mine by joining a mining pool. However, the returns are limited because most pools split the rewards based on the amount of work each miner contributes. These systems can't compete with the , but it's possible to come out a few hundred dollars ahead after accounting for the energy used. If you want to be competitive, you'll need to buy several ASIC miners and join a pool, which can set you back between $1,000 and $8,000 per rig. The faster a machine mines, the more it will cost. \n  * : Network speeds do not significantly affect the Bitcoin mining process, but latency does. Latency is the amount of time it takes to communicate with the rest of the network. Also, mining farms require multiple internal connections to connect each mining rig to a main router or server with a connection to the internet. However, if you're using your gaming rig to mine and join a pool, you shouldn't need any extra bandwidth—just low latency to the pool you joined.\n\n\nThe total costs for these three inputs should be less than the output—in this case, Bitcoin's price— from your venture. Considering the fluctuating—and often rising—Bitcoin price, the idea of minting your own cryptocurrency might sound like an attractive proposition. \nBut given the economic difficulties of Bitcoin mining, you may have to resign yourself to accepting lower profits and a longer timeframe to break even, after purchasing in the lottery that Bitcoin has become. \nTwo developments have contributed to the evolution and composition of Bitcoin mining as it is today. First, the custom manufacturing of mining Bitcoin machines acted to centralize the network. Because Bitcoin mining is essentially sequential guesswork, arriving at the right answer before another miner has almost everything to do with how fast your devices can produce hashes. \nIn the early days of Bitcoin, desktop computers with ordinary CPUs dominated Bitcoin mining. However, they began taking a long time to discover the solution on the blockchain network as the algorithm's difficulty level increased with time. \nOver time, miners realized that (GPUs), or graphics cards, were more effective and faster at mining. But they consumed a lot of power and weren't designed for heavy mining. Eventually, manufacturers had to limit their mining because the increase in demand for GPUs made their prices skyrocket and decreased availability for other types of users. \nMany miners now use custom mining machines, referred to as Application-Specific Integrated Circuit (ASIC). are equipped with specialized chips for faster and more efficient Bitcoin mining. They cost anywhere from several hundred to tens of thousands of dollars. Today, Bitcoin mining is so competitive that it can only be done profitably with the most up-to-date ASICs. But even with the newest unit at your disposal, one is rarely enough to compete with mining pools and large Bitcoin mining operations. \nThese mining operations are like large data centers full of mining-specific computers. The amount of computations they can perform is staggering, which can result in hundreds of trillions per second. \nThere are many concerns surrounding Bitcoin mining. The most obvious is the astronomical odds of being the one to solve the equation, which, as of December 2025, have been calculated at one in 148 trillion; this number constantly fluctuates over time. Scaling difficulty levels and the massive network of miners also present hardships; one block of transactions is verified roughly every 10 minutes. \nBut it's important to remember that 10 minutes is a goal, not a rule. Bitcoin mining requires a lot of energy to keep the operation running, which can make the process of mining the digital currency futile if it does not generate a certain degree of success for the miner. \nThe Bitcoin network can currently process between two and four transactions per second, with transactions logged in the blockchain about every 10 minutes. By comparison, Visa can process about 1,700 transactions per second. Second-layer solutions and upgrades to the Bitcoin blockchain have attempted to address speed issues, but modern banking networks and other blockchains still dwarf the number of transactions the Bitcoin network can handle. \nThe main issue at the heart of the Bitcoin protocol is scaling—the blockchain's ability to handle more work efficiently. Though Bitcoin miners generally agree that something must be done to address scaling, there is no consensus on how to do it. \nBitcoin has been adjusted by and accepting input from layers that do much of the work off-chain, but it still has issues with . When making adjustments, blockchain is surrounded by three central concerns: decentralization, security, and scalability. With current technology, one cannot be changed without affecting another. For example, if the Bitcoin blockchain were altered so that it could scale more effectively, it would likely decrease security and increase centralization. \nNot surprisingly, in an age where all endeavors should have their environmental impacts evaluated and adjusted, have drawn attention and criticism. Bitcoin's competitive PoW mechanism is what causes it to use so much energy. According to some estimates, the blockchain's mining process consumes as much electricity as some small countries. \nFor most of Bitcoin's short history, its mining process has remained energy-intensive. In the decade after it was launched, Bitcoin mining was concentrated in China, a country that relies on fossil fuels like coal to produce a majority of its electricity. But crackdowns in China forced miners to move their operations elsewhere. \nAccording to the latest data from the University of Cambridge, most Bitcoin mining operations are now centered in the U.S. Of the nearly 38% of global Bitcoin mining activity conducted in the U.S., more than 62% is concentrated in four states: Georgia (30.76%), Texas (11.22%), Kentucky (10.93%), and New York (9.77%). This means that four states make up more than 23% of the world's Bitcoin mining energy use and, theoretically, its hashing power. \nHashing power is how fast a computer, miner, or network can generate solutions (hashes) to the cryptographic problem. For instance, as of December 2025, the Bitcoin network had an average hashrate of more than one ZettaHash (sextillion) per second. That's one followed by 21 zeros—hashes per second. \nAs with anything that involves money, Bitcoin and Bitcoin mining attract a lot of bad-faith actors. If you decide to begin mining, you must be vigilant for mining scams before investing significant capital in picking the software, tools, or networks. \n  * : These are websites that claim to rent mining power to customers. Not all of these services are scams, but make sure you read reviews, talk to others, and conduct your due diligence before choosing one.\n\n\nThere are other types of fraud and scams, but the best way to prevent falling victim is to never give your keys, seed phrases, or passwords to anyone. Additionally, don't put your trust in a person you've never met or a service that doesn't have a well-established reputation. \nIf you're interested in mining but don't want to become personally involved in the process or take on the risks, you may want to invest in Bitcoin mining companies. Some public companies that own or are affiliated with Bitcoin mining are Hut 8 (), MARA Holdings (), and Clean Spark (), but there are many others to choose from \nAs of December 2025, the reward for mining one block is 3.125 bitcoins. It takes the network about 10 minutes to mine one block, so it takes about 10 minutes to mine 3.125 bitcoins.\nIn most places, mining is legal. However, some countries and jurisdictions restrict the practice, so make sure you check to see if it is legal in your area before beginning.\nBitcoin mining is an energy-intensive process involving mining devices and software that compete to solve a cryptographic problem. The Bitcoin mining process also confirms transactions on the cryptocurrency's network. As an incentive to participate in the process, Bitcoin is awarded to those who win the competition. \nThough individual miners using desktop systems played a role during the cryptocurrency's early days, the Bitcoin mining ecosystem is now dominated by large mining companies that run mining pools spread across geographical scales, increasing the level of competition in Bitcoin mining for all. \nInvestopedia requires writers to use primary sources to support their work.

      "markdown": "Proof of Work (PoW) is a foundational consensus mechanism in blockchain technology. It requires substantial computational effort to validate transactions, ensuring the security and integrity of the blockchain network without reliance on a trusted third party. Initially popularized by Bitcoin, PoW underpins many cryptocurrencies by facilitating secure peer-to-peer transaction processing. \n\n\nIn some blockchains, proof of work shows that a program completed the tasks needed to propose a new block. It is commonly called a because, eventually, network consensus is reached after there is proof that the work was done honestly (in this case, \"honestly\" means there were no attempts to alter data). \nProof of work is provided by sending the information in a block through a hashing algorithm, then adjusting variable fields until a hexadecimal number is reached that has a lower value than the network's . This serves as proof that the program expended the computational effort to \"hash\" the block until a solution was reached. \nThe offers that appear in this table are from partnerships from which Investopedia receives compensation. This compensation may impact how and where listings appear. Investopedia does not include all offers available in the marketplace.\nFirst, the worker, which is called a miner, creates a temporary file (a block). If it wins the competition to solve for a winning hash, this file will be stored on the blockchain. The block has the four following fields: \nThe mining program creates a block, adding the transactions it prioritizes to the transaction field. It continuously adjusts the and the extra nonce (which is part of the coinbase transaction in the ) and sends the information in the block through a hashing algorithm. \nThe process repeats until a solution is found—a value equal to or less than the difficulty target. The difficulty target is set so that a certain number of hashes per second must be attempted before a solution is found. For example, on May 17, 2024, block 843,900 had a difficulty target of 83.148T, or 83.148 trillion attempts per second per miner. \nConsensus, a state of agreement throughout the blockchain network, happens after a block is closed and added to the chain. While working on proposing new blocks and generating winning hashes, each miner also validates each new block as it is added. Each miner broadcasts to the network that the block it confirmed is valid. \nNew blocks use the previous block's header hash to make a chain of proof, leading to network consensus. This is why these proofs are called consensus mechanisms—because they form the basis of how consensus is reached. \nThe two most popular consensus mechanisms are proof of work and . Bitcoin's top competitor, Ethereum, used proof of work on its blockchain until September 2022, when its highly anticipated transition to proof of stake was made. Here are some of the key differences between the two. \nProof of work mining is competitive, with many trying to earn a profit. Because minable cryptocurrency has market value, businesses have emerged and overtaken most of the computational power used by proof of work blockchains. \nFor example, on May 17, 2024, FoundryDigital had the most hashing power on Bitcoin, 175 EH/s out of 673 EH/s total. Foundry Digital is owned by Digital Currency Group, a venture firm that has funded or invested in hundreds of cryptocurrency projects. \nBitcoin and other proof of work cryptocurrencies were originally designed for individual use and hosting. However, individuals have been pushed out of the processes by businesses that have centralized them for profit. \nPoW requires nodes on a network to provide evidence that they have expended computational power (i.e., work) to achieve consensus in a decentralized manner and to prevent bad actors from overtaking the network. Proof of stake requires collateral in the form of staked cryptocurrency to become a trusted participant.\nCurrent financial systems are built around a need for trust. But when it comes to finances, it has been the case time and again that some people cannot be trusted to do the right thing. A proof removes the need to trust that others are acting honestly because it is code. Code is not tempted by money, so if it is written with good intentions and cannot be altered, it can replace our need to trust people we don't know.\nProof of work (PoW) is an essential blockchain consensus mechanism that validates transactions and secures the network through a decentralized process. It requires miners to solve encryption puzzles, which ensures secure peer-to-peer transactions. While PoW can enable robust security, it also demands substantial energy and computational resources in certain circumstances, emphasizing the importance of understanding its environmental implications. As seen with cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, PoW fosters a competitive mining environment, providing rewards and transaction fees to participants for their computational efforts. \n_The comments, opinions, and analyses expressed on Investopedia are for informational purposes only.

      "title": "Understanding Proof-of-Stake: How PoS Transforms Cryptocurrency",
      "markdown": "\n\nProof-of-Stake (PoS) revolutionizes the way cryptocurrencies process transactions and build new blocks by utilizing a consensus mechanism that relies on randomly selected validators, rather than the computationally intensive process seen in Proof-of-Work (PoW) systems. \nThis method involves coin owners staking their cryptocurrency to earn the opportunity to validate transactions, thereby enhancing security and reducing environmental impact. As blockchain technology continues to evolve, understanding the differences and advantages of PoS over traditional PoW protocols is crucial for addressing the challenges faced by the cryptocurrency industry today. \n  * Proof-of-Stake (PoS) is a consensus mechanism that reduces the need for computational power by using randomly selected validators to confirm transactions and create new blocks, significantly lowering energy consumption compared to Proof-of-Work (PoW).\n\n\nProof-of-stake reduces the computational work needed for verifying and transactions. While proof-of-work relies on heavy computing for security, proof-of-stake allows coin owners to use their machines to verify blocks with less computational effort. Owners stake their coins as collateral, earning the opportunity to validate blocks and receive rewards. \nThe offers that appear in this table are from partnerships from which Investopedia receives compensation. This compensation may impact how and where listings appear. Investopedia does not include all offers available in the marketplace.\nTo become a validator, a coin owner must \"stake\" a specific amount of coins. For example, requires users to stake 32 ETH to operate a node. Multiple validators must confirm a block's accuracy before it is finalized and closed. Blocks are validated by multiple validators, and when a specific number of validators verify that the block is accurate, it is finalized and closed. \nTo activate your own validator, you'll need to stake 32 ETH; however, you don't need to stake that much ETH to participate in validation. You can join validation pools using \"liquid staking\" which uses an ERC-20 token that represents your ETH.\nDifferent proof-of-stake mechanisms use various methods to achieve consensus. For instance, in Ethereum's sharding, a validator checks transactions and adds them to a shard block, needing up to 128 validators to form a voting \"committee.\" After shard validation, two-thirds of validators must concur on the transaction's validity to close the block. \nBoth consensus mechanisms help blockchains synchronize data, validate information, and process transactions. Each method has proven successful at maintaining a blockchain, although each has pros and cons. However, the two algorithms have very different approaches. \nUnder PoS, block creators are called validators. A validator checks transactions, verifies activity, votes on outcomes, and maintains records. Under PoW, block creators are called miners. Miners work to solve a hashing problem to verify transactions. In return for solving it, they are rewarded with a coin. \nTo become a block creator in PoS, you need to own enough coins or tokens to qualify as a validator. In contrast, PoW miners must invest in processing equipment and pay high energy costs to solve computations. \nHigh equipment and energy costs in PoW limit mining access and enhance blockchain security. PoS blockchains need less processing power to validate blocks and transactions. The mechanism also lowers network congestion and removes the rewards-based incentive PoW blockchains have. \nProof-of-stake is designed to reduce network congestion and address surrounding the proof-of-work (PoW) protocol. is a competitive approach to verifying transactions, which naturally encourages people to look for ways to gain an advantage, especially since monetary value is involved. \nBitcoin miners earn bitcoin by verifying transactions and blocks. However, they pay their operating expenses, such as electricity and rent, with . So what's really happening is that miners exchange energy for cryptocurrency, which causes to use as much energy as some small countries. \nPoS addresses these issues by replacing computational power with staking, allowing the network to randomize mining ability. This means there should be a drastic reduction in energy consumption since miners can no longer rely on massive farms of single-purpose hardware to gain an advantage. For example, Ethereum's transition from PoW to PoS reduced the blockchain's energy consumption by 99.84%. \nLong touted as a threat to cryptocurrency fans, the is a concern when PoS is used, but it is doubtful it will occur. A 51% attack in PoW happens when an entity controls over half the network’s miners and alters the blockchain. In PoS, this would require owning 51% of the staked cryptocurrency. \nIt's very expensive to control 51% of staked cryptocurrency. Under Ethereum's PoS, if a 51% attack occurred, the honest validators in the network could vote to disregard the altered blockchain and burn the offender(s) staked ETH. This incentivizes validators to act in good faith to benefit the cryptocurrency and the network. \nMost other security features of PoS are not advertised, as this might create an opportunity to circumvent security measures. However, most PoS systems have extra security features in place that add to the inherent security behind blockchains and PoS mechanisms. \nUnder Proof of Stake (POS) consensus, users must generally own a cryptocurrency before they can participate in consensus and earn more crypto. To host a full validator node on Ethereum, a user needs to stake 32 ETH, which is very expensive. Another disadvantage of PoS is that on blockchains with smaller networks, a large minimum stake could lead to centralization.\nEthereum uses proof-of-stake as its consensus mechanic. Full validator nodes require a stake of 32 ETH, but other participants can take part in consensus by delegating their ETH to a validator or participating in staking pools. Users can also stake small amounts of ETH on their own, but no rewards are earned.\nProof-of-stake is a mechanism used to verify blockchain transactions. It differs from proof-of-work significantly, mainly in the fact that it incentivizes honest behavior by rewarding those who put their crypto up as collateral for a chance to earn more. \nInvestopedia requires writers to use primary sources to support their work.

      "markdown": "\n\n\n\n\n\nConsensus mechanisms are critical for blockchain systems, providing a reliable way to agree on the data's state without human intervention. These mechanisms enhance the trust, accuracy, and security of digital transactions, replacing the need for slower human verifiers. They play a vital role in maintaining decentralized networks' integrity. \n  * Proof of Work (PoW) and Proof of Stake (PoS) are two of the most widely used consensus mechanisms in cryptocurrency networks due to their distinct methods of validating transactions and maintaining security. \n\n\nWhen computers and networks began gaining popularity in the 1980s and 90s, shared databases were created so that multiple users could access the information they stored. Most had a centralized database with permissions that users accessed from different workstations. This setup evolved into centralized networks with administrators who granted user rights and maintained the integrity of the data. \nSome of these shared databases developed into programs that distributed storage and processing power across a network of storage devices in different locations. One of the most significant issues that needed addressing was that of preventing data tampering and unauthorized access, whether it was malicious or not. A method to automate distributed database management was required to ensure data was not changed. \nThis need led to the creation of distributed autonomous consensus, where programs on a network agreed on a database's state using cryptographic techniques. Agreement was designed to be reached using encryption algorithms to create long strings of alphanumeric numbers—called a hash—which were then verified by programs running on the network. A hash only changes if the information input into the hashing algorithm is changed, so the programs were designed to compare hashes to ensure they matched. \nThe offers that appear in this table are from partnerships from which Investopedia receives compensation. This compensation may impact how and where listings appear. Investopedia does not include all offers available in the marketplace.\nWhen each program running on the network created a matching alphanumeric string, the data was said to be agreed upon by consensus of the network. Thus, consensus mechanisms were made, with credit generally given to Satoshi Nakamoto, the anonymous Bitcoin creator. However, many people worked on consensus mechanisms for years before Nakamoto released the whitepaper that made Bitcoin famous. \nis a common consensus mechanism used by the most popular cryptocurrency networks, such as Bitcoin and Litecoin. It requires a participant node to prove that the work done and submitted by them was valid, and a large network of programs to verify it. However, the Bitcoin consensus mechanism requires high energy consumption and long processing times. \nis another common consensus mechanism that evolved as a low-cost, low-energy-consuming alternative to PoW. It involves allocating responsibility in proposing new blocks to a participant node in proportion to the number of virtual currency tokens held. The rest of the network then verifies the block and adds it to the blockchain if consensus is reached. \nProof of History (PoH) was developed by the Solana Project. It is similar to (PoET), which encodes the passage of time cryptographically to achieve consensus without expending many resources.\nWhile PoW and PoS are the most common, other consensus algorithms exist. (PoC) allows contributing nodes to share storage space. Nodes with more hard disk space receive more rights for maintaining the public ledger. (PoA), used on the blockchain, is a hybrid that makes use of aspects of both PoW and PoS. (PoB) requires transactors to send small amounts of cryptocurrency to inaccessible wallet addresses, in effect \"burning\" them out of existence. \nResearchers are experimenting with consensus mechanisms to securely scale blockchains while maintaining decentralization. Many consensus mechanisms are used, but most don't improve security, scalability, and decentralization simultaneously. Rather, one of these factors is generally sacrificed to improve one or two of the others, even on the blockchains that claim to have \"solved\" this trilemma. \nTo address this lingering \"blockchain trilemma\" issue, some researchers are proposing artificial intelligence/machine learning (AI/ML) enabled blockchains and consensus mechanisms. There are myriad proposed methods for implementing AI/ML into blockchains—some use clusters of mobile nodes and AI/ML to manage the nodes, while others discuss using existing consensus mechanisms to train AI/ML-enabled consensus algorithms. \nMany of these are being developed to address three issues: first, to create fair reward models; second, to reduce their environmental impact; and third, to increase their speed without sacrificing security, decentralization, and scalability. \nIf developers have their say (which they likely will because they're the ones creating this technology), the current state of cryptocurrencies and blockchains is not what it will eventually be, but what it all will turn into is another unknown. \nSimilar to all technological developments, Bitcoin and other existing blockchain systems will likely become outdated as advances are made—researchers are already proposing quantum state-based consensus protocols in addition to AI-enhanced ones. The next step is AI-enhanced quantum state-based consensus for blockchains and cryptocurrencies. \nBased on the common definitions of consensus mechanisms and algorithms, proof of work is an example of a consensus algorithm. However, algorithms and mechanisms differ in that mechanisms usually carry out the processes that algorithms describe. In reality, on blockchains, consensus algorithms tell consensus mechanisms how to achieve consensus.\nConsensus mechanisms are pivotal in ensuring the integrity and security of distributed ledgers, databases, and blockchains, as digital transformation accelerates. These mechanisms replace slower, human-based verification with automated processes, ensuring accurate and trustworthy transaction data. As the world increasingly tokenizes assets and integrates decentralized finance, consensus mechanisms provide essential security and efficiency. By automatically verifying and securing data, they eliminate the need for trust between transaction parties, resulting in a safer, decentralized financial environment. \nDid you know that 82% of Nvidia’s gains between March 2024 and February 2025 happened outside of regular Nasdaq hours?* on 100+ US shares 24 hours a day, meaning you never need to miss out when the markets move. for super-fast execution backed by dedicated support. 74-89% of retail CFD accounts lose money *Data from the Pepperstone platform. \nInvestopedia requires writers to use primary sources to support their work.

It's called a wallet because it is used similarly to the traditional wallet you use to organize cash and cards. Instead of holding these physical items, it stores the passkeys you use to sign for your cryptocurrency transactions. It provides the interface that lets you access your crypto, simplifying transactions and safeguarding digital assets. There are two main types of wallets: custodial and noncustodial. \nWhen cryptocurrency was first introduced, sending it was a manual task that required entering long keys.

The second wallet belonged to Hal Finney, who corresponded with Nakamoto and reportedly was the first to run the Bitcoin client software wallet. Nakamoto sent him 10 bitcoins as a test, and the cryptocurrency craze began. \nCryptocurrency wallets are software applications on computers or mobile devices such as phones or tablets. They use an internet connection to access the blockchain network for the cryptocurrency you're using. \nCryptocurrencies are not \"stored\" anywhere—they are bits of data in a database, scattered all over it; the wallet finds all of the bits associated with your public address and sums up the amount for you in the app's interface. \nThe offers that appear in this table are from partnerships from which Investopedia receives compensation. This compensation may impact how and where listings appear. Investopedia does not include all offers available in the marketplace.\nSending and receiving cryptocurrency is very easy using these applications. You can send or receive cryptocurrency from your wallet using various methods. Typically, you enter the recipient's wallet address, choose an amount to send, sign the transaction using your private key, add an amount to pay the transaction fee, and send it. \nMany wallets have integrated QR codes and near-field scanner technology that allows you to scan a code, select an amount, enter your key, select the transaction fee, and click send.\nThere are two main types of wallets: custodial and noncustodial. Custodial wallets (also called online wallets) are hosted by a third party that stores your keys for you. This could be a company that provides enterprise-level data security systems businesses use to preserve and secure data. Some offer custodial wallets for their customers. Noncustodial wallets are wallets in which you take responsibility for securing your keys. This is the type that most cryptocurrency wallets on devices are. \nThere are two subcategories of wallets: . A hot wallet has a connection to the internet or to a device that has a connection, and a has no connection. Lastly, there are three subcategories of wallets—software, hardware, and paper. \nSo, you can have a noncustodial software hot wallet, a noncustodial hardware cold or , or a custodial hardware cold wallet. These are the most common types, but you may also encounter other combinations. \nSoftware wallets include applications for desktops and mobile devices. These wallets are installed on a desktop or laptop computer and can access your cryptocurrency, make transactions, display your balance, and much more. Some software wallets also include additional functionality, such as exchange integration if you're using a wallet designed by a cryptocurrency exchange. \nMany mobile wallets can facilitate quick payments in physical stores through (NFC) or by scanning a . Mobile wallets tend to be compatible with iOS or Android devices. Trezor, Electrum, and Mycelium are examples of wallets that you can use. Software wallets are generally hot wallets. \nHardware wallets are the most popular type of wallet because you can store your private keys and remove them from your device. These devices might resemble a USB drive, and modern hardware wallets have several features. \nYou can make a cryptocurrency transaction on your computer or device by plugging in the hardware wallet. Most of them can sign cryptocurrency transactions automatically without requiring you to enter the key, circumventing a hacker's ability to log your keypresses or record your screen. \nThese devices often cost between $100 to $200. are both well-known hardware wallets. Hardware wallets are generally considered cold wallets because they don't have an active connection until they are plugged in. \nSome new hardware wallets come with the ability to connect to your device through Bluetooth. Use these with caution because Bluetooth is a wireless signal that can be accessed by unwanted parties when it is turned on.\nEarly crypto users would write or type their keys on paper, which they called . These evolved to include the keys and QR codes so wallets on mobile devices could scan them. However, paper wallets are easily damaged or lost, so many crypto owners do not use them anymore. \nHowever, there is nothing wrong with using a paper wallet if you take measures to store it properly in a safe or deposit box and check on it once in a while to ensure it hasn't deteriorated. \nWallet safety is essential, as cryptocurrencies are high-value targets for . Some safeguards include , using two-factor authentication for exchanges, and storing any large amounts you have offline. \nMost modern wallets generate a 12-word mnemonic seed phrase. An example phrase could be \"airport bedroom impression sample reception protection road shirt...\" which seems random but is created and linked to your keys by your wallet. You can use the phrase to restore the wallet if the device is lost or damaged. These words should be carefully stored in a safe place because anyone who finds them will be able to access your cryptocurrency. \nAdditionally, if the cryptocurrency exchange goes out of business, there may be no guarantees that you'll get your cryptocurrency back. For example, Coinbase, a popular exchange, announced in its quarterly report to the Securities and Exchange Commission in May 2022 that: \n> ...because custodially held crypto assets may be considered to be the property of a bankruptcy estate, in the event of a bankruptcy, the crypto assets we hold in custody on behalf of our customers could be subject to bankruptcy proceedings and such customers could be treated as our general unsecured creditors. \nGeneral unsecured creditors are lower in priority on the list of creditors in a bankruptcy proceeding. Therefore, if there are not enough to liquidate and meet financial requirements for higher priority creditors, it is possible to lose your crypto assets if your custodial wallet company declares bankruptcy. \nThe best cryptocurrency key security measures involve removing your keys from your wallet, placing them in a form of cold storage, and securing them in a vault, safe, or deposit box. The more steps it takes for you to access your cryptocurrency keys, the harder it is for a criminal to access them. This way, you ensure you don't lose your keys. It also ensures that someone you have entrusted with your keys doesn't lose them or deny you access to them. \nThere are various , with many options. It's best to read as many reviews as possible to find one that fits your needs while ensuring your keys are secure.\nThe has no connection on its own or to a device with internet access.

These wallets provide ease of access but pose heightened security risks. Understanding their function and how to enhance their security can better safeguard your cryptocurrency assets.\nA hot wallet is a cryptocurrency wallet that is always connected to the internet or another connected device. Hot wallets are used as temporary key storage and to send and receive cryptocurrency. Usually, their interfaces also allow you to view how many tokens you have available. \n\n\nWhen you acquire cryptocurrency, you need a wallet for transactions if you plan to use it for buying goods or services. Your ' private keys, used for access, are stored in these wallets when you receive coins. \nOwning cryptocurrency gives you for accessing it. Public keys, like usernames, identify the wallet and let users receive tokens without exposing their identity. Private keys are similar to personal identification numbers that must be entered when creating a transaction. These wallets use usernames and passwords, but can also employ other login methods. \nHot wallets are applications connected to the internet and the cryptocurrency infrastructure, which allows you to use them. The hot wallet serves as an interface for users to use and store cryptocurrency keys. \nThe offers that appear in this table are from partnerships from which Investopedia receives compensation. This compensation may impact how and where listings appear.

You can even write your keys on a piece of paper, which is considered a cold wallet. To use the cryptocurrency you have in cold storage, you need to transfer the keys to your hot wallet. \nThere are various hot wallets available, and many of them are free to download. Some wallets are specifically designed to be used in partnership with particular mobile web applications; you might find one that only works with a particular cryptocurrency or ecosystem. In addition, some cryptocurrency exchanges will only accept transfers to and from specific wallets. \nExamples of hot wallets are MetaMask, Coinbase Wallet, and Edge Wallet. MetaMask is designed . Coinbase Wallet is the wallet for the cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase, and Edge Wallet is designed to accept transactions using all of your digital assets. \nBecause there are so many wallets with different designs and intents, it's important for you to research hot wallets before downloading and using their services. Wallet developers have varying degrees of expertise, various commitments to security and privacy, and different priorities in mind when creating their wallets. Some might have fees; others might not. You might need to use one wallet that integrates with your internet browser for one currency and another wallet that is a dedicated application. \nOn the internet, you might find cryptocurrency cold and hot wallets broken down into many categories like hardware, software, web, desktop, or mobile. All the different categories and definitions exist because many businesses are trying to get you to spend money, and writers, academics, and enthusiasts are trying to standardize cryptocurrency and blockchain definitions or demonstrate their expertise. What's important to remember when you're reading about wallets is that it doesn't matter what it is called:\n\n\nThere are several aspects you should consider before deciding on your hot wallet. Most important are its security features and how you use them. Your cryptocurrency is only as safe as the way you store your keys. Any items stored in a hot wallet are vulnerable to hacks, malware, ransomware, or any other method thieves can think of. \nThe old saying, \"Don't keep all of your eggs in one basket,\" applies to many financial assets, including cryptocurrency. If you use more than one storage type or strategy, you're minimizing the risks of theft and loss.\nKeep only a small portion of your crypto-assets in your hot wallet; only add what you need when you need it. This strategy would mean storing most of your assets in a cold wallet and transferring what you need to the hot wallet for immediate or near-future use. \nYou might keep cryptocurrency tokens in accounts linked to your exchange. Some will have insurance for asset loss due to theft or system failure and may reimburse up to a set amount. These exchanges either subcontract custodial services and transfer your keys to them or have built data storage methods designed for key storage. \nIf an attacker breaches the exchange network, you could lose cryptocurrency stored there. To help customers if this happens, some exchanges are insured for the loss of customers' assets if they (the exchange) lose them due to theft or failure of their systems and will reimburse you up to a certain amount. \nIf you maintain a substantial balance of cryptocurrency, you're accepting the risk of drawing the attention of hackers or losing a significant portion of your holdings in an attack. Because many of the top digital currency exchanges allow users to transfer between various fiat currencies and cryptocurrencies, you should only hold small amounts in your wallet. You can convert the rest to your country's currency and place it in your bank account. \nThere might be fees for exchanging cryptocurrency for fiat currency and transferring the funds out of the exchange or removing it to store it, but it's worth considering if you're not holding your cryptocurrency as an investment.\nis similar to stock market investing—you own a cryptocurrency and wait for its fair market value to increase. You could continue holding it or try to sell it to another investor at a profit. However, a hot wallet is a precarious place to store your cryptocurrency investments. Cold storage, such as a or other non-connected methods, might serve you better as you wait for your cryptocurrency's value to increase. \nYou could also use a custodial cold wallet, such as a reputable, regulated, and insured exchange's cold storage or . Another option is to invest in a cryptocurrency ETF that holds cryptocurrency so that you gain exposure to these assets without needing to secure them yourself. \nOnly keep small amounts in your hot wallet, ensure you back it up, keep the software up to date, encrypt it, and keep your password secure to make sure your wallet is safe.\nMany hot wallets are free because they are downloadable software or apps. There are some devices with software uploaded on them that can act as hot and cold wallets. Depending on the options, these can range from less than $100 to hundreds of dollars.\nHot wallets are cryptocurrency storage solutions connected to the internet, allowing users to send, receive, and store digital assets. However, due to their constant connectivity, they are more susceptible to security risks like hacking and malware. To safeguard your assets, use hot wallets primarily for transactions and store only small amounts in them; transfer larger balances to for enhanced security.

      "title": "Cold Storage: What It Is, How It Works, Theft Protection",
      "markdown": "A \"cold wallet\" is a device or method for storing cryptocurrency private keys offline. Private keys are transferred from a device with an internet connection to a device without one. Businesses, governments, and individuals have used this data security technique for several decades to keep data inaccessible or save it for later use. In most cases, it is called cold storage, but cryptocurrency fans and users prefer to call a device that stores keys offline a cold wallet. \nCold storage methods are useful for individual investors and users, but some of the and companies involved in the crypto space also make use of this type of storage. \n\n\nWhen your checking, savings, or account with a traditional bank has been compromised, the bank can refund the lost or stolen money back to you. Banks can find out where money has gone because the transactions are digital and can be tracked using account numbers and names. Money can be moved back into your account, and the thieves can be dealt with. \nHowever, if your wallet has been compromised and your tokens have been stolen, you're unable to recover your coins or otherwise be reimbursed. First, they are not insured or backed by a government or institution. Second, this is due to the way blockchains are designed. Wallet addresses are publicly available, but no names or personal information is stored or is publicly available—and because of the way information is chained on a blockchain, transactions cannot be reversed. \nA cryptocurrency is assigned a key that serves as its address, much like an email address. This key does not need to be securely stored anywhere, but keeping it private ensures anonymity. \nThe offers that appear in this table are from partnerships from which Investopedia receives compensation. This compensation may impact how and where listings appear. Investopedia does not include all offers available in the marketplace.\nare the alphanumeric codes used to access cryptocurrency—this is what thieves are after. All cryptocurrency storage methods involve protecting these private keys because they provide access to the tokens. Private keys are similar to the password or PIN you use to access your bank account app—if someone steals that, they can wreak havoc on your finances. \nPrivate keys stored on a wallet connected to the internet are vulnerable to network-based theft. All the functions required to complete a transaction are made from a single online device—thus, connected wallets are one of the weak links in a network. This is because they are devices that use software which hackers can alter. \nCold storage reduces the chances of private key theft by removing them from an online environment. In most cases, transferring private keys to cold storage is not as complicated as it might seem. \nThere are many ways of storing cryptocurrencies, and many of the methods you read about on the internet have changed over time—so it's worth discussing storage types. There are two general types of storage. One is where someone else holds your keys for you, called . The other is where you hold your keys, called non-custodial storage. \nThe subtypes are the methods you might read about—paper, software, hardware, cold, and hot. So, you could give your keys to your exchange to hold for you in its enterprise security-level vault, which would be a custodial cold storage hardware method. \nIf you want to hold the keys yourself, you can place them on a USB device designed for crypto key storage. This would be a non-custodial storage method that would transition between hot and cold as you connected it to and disconnected it from your computer. You could also write or type your keys on a piece of paper, delete them from your wallet app, and place the paper in a safe—this is also non-custodial cold storage. \nThe most basic form of cold storage is a . A paper wallet is simply a document that has public and private keys written on it. In the case of a bitcoin paper wallet, you can print the document with a wired printer. You can also use a generator and print it on the paper so that it can easily be scanned and signed to make a transaction. However, this requires exposing your keys to more software, which can increase the risk of theft. \nAnother drawback to this medium is that if the paper is lost, rendered illegible, or destroyed, you'll never be able to access your funds. If you choose this method, be sure to have a safe box or another secure storage method for the paper wallet itself and make backups. \nAnother form of cold storage is a hardware wallet that uses an offline device or smart card to generate private keys offline. The Ledger USB Wallet is an example of a that uses a smart card to secure private keys. Two other popular hardware wallets are TREZOR and KeepKey. The device looks and functions like a USB drive; a computer and a Chrome-based app are required to store the private keys offline. You can use anything from a standard USB storage drive to an advanced device with a battery, Bluetooth, software, and other features. Like a paper wallet, it is essential to store this USB device and smart card in a safe place, as any damage or loss could terminate access to your cryptocurrency. \nAir-gapped devices have no connection ability and are more secure than ones that can connect wirelessly. You can buy commercial hardware wallets from retailers and merchants; many are waterproof and virus-proof—some even support (\"multi-sig\") transactions. Multi-sig is a cryptocurrency signature method that requires more than one user to approve a transaction using private keys. \nSoftware wallets are applications that run on a device, such as a smartphone, tablet, or personal computer. Because these devices are generally connected or can connect to the internet, they are usually and should not be used to store private keys. \nUsers looking for cold storage options can also opt for offline software wallets, which are quite similar to hardware wallets but are a more complex process for less technical users. An offline software wallet splits a wallet into two accessible platforms—an offline wallet that contains the private keys and an online wallet that has the public keys stored. \nThe online wallet generates new, unsigned transactions and sends the user's address to the receiver or sender on the other end of the transaction. The unsigned transaction is moved to the offline wallet and signed with the private key. The signed transaction is then moved back to the online wallet, which broadcasts it to the network. Because the offline wallet never connects to the internet, its stored private keys remain secure. Electrum and Armory are often quoted as the best offline software wallets in the crypto economy. \nSound wallets are an obscure, expensive, and time-consuming way to store and access your keys, depending on your chosen medium. Sound wallets involve encrypting and recording your private keys in sound files on products such as CDs or removable USB drives. The code hidden in these audio files can be deciphered using a spectroscope application or high-resolution spectroscope. \nPlacing your hardware wallet in your safe is secure, but it isn't considered deep cold storage because it is easy for you to access. Deep cold storage is any method that is very inconvenient and requires time and effort to retrieve your keys. This could be anything from placing your hardware wallet in a waterproof container and burying it six feet down in your garden to using a third-party service that stores your cryptocurrency keys in a vault that requires multiple steps to access. \nBurying your keys deep in the garden has several drawbacks, including lots of digging and remembering where you buried them, but so does the ultra-secure vault service. Vault services generally require your identity, proof of address, or other means of identification. Additionally, it can take hours or days to access your keys, depending on where they are physically stored, so if you prefer to be able to access your cryptocurrency quickly, this might not be an option. \nCold storage, called cold wallets by cryptocurrency users, is the most secure way to store your cryptocurrency's private keys. It involves transferring the keys to a device or medium that is not connected to the internet. There are various choices for the best wallet based on experience, security, and integration. \nDid you know that 82% of Nvidia’s gains between March 2024 and February 2025 happened outside of regular Nasdaq hours?* on 100+ US shares 24 hours a day, meaning you never need to miss out when the markets move. for super-fast execution backed by dedicated support. 74-89% of retail CFD accounts lose money *Data from the Pepperstone platform. \nThe offers that appear in this table are from partnerships from which Investopedia receives compensation.

      "title": "What Is a Bitcoin Exchange? How It Works, Fees, and Example",
      "markdown": "A Bitcoin exchange is a digital marketplace or online platform where traders can buy and sell Bitcoins using different fiat currencies or altcoins. These marketplaces and platforms act as intermediaries and facilitators between cryptocurrency buyers and sellers. \n  * A Bitcoin exchange works like a brokerage, and you can deposit money via bank transfer, wire, and other common means of deposit. However, you will often pay a price for this service.\n\n\nBitcoin exchange platforms match buyers with sellers. Like a traditional stock exchange, traders can opt to buy and sell bitcoin by inputting either a or a . When a market order is selected, the trader authorizes the exchange to trade the coins for the best available price in the online marketplace. A limit order directs the exchange to trade coins for a price below the current ask or above the current bid, depending on whether they are buying or selling. \nTo transact in Bitcoin on a regulated exchange, a user must register with the exchange and undergo a series of verification processes to authenticate their identity. Once the authentication is successful, an account is opened for the user, who must then transfer funds into it before they can buy coins. \nDifferent exchanges have different payment methods that can be used to deposit funds. Funds can include bank wires, direct bank transfers, credit or debit cards, bank drafts, money orders, and even gift cards. A trader who would like to withdraw money from the account could do so using the options provided by their exchange, including a bank transfer, PayPal transfer, check mailing, cash delivery, bank wire, or credit card transfer. \nDecentralized Bitcoin exchanges operate without a central authority, only providing a place for buyers and sellers to connect. These exchanges allow peer-to-peer trading of digital currencies without the need for someone to facilitate the transactions. \nThe offers that appear in this table are from partnerships from which Investopedia receives compensation. This compensation may impact how and where listings appear. Investopedia does not include all offers available in the marketplace.\nThere are a few benefits to decentralized exchanges. First, many cryptocurrency users feel they better match the decentralized structures of most digital currencies themselves; several decentralized exchanges also require less personal information from their members than centralized (registered and regulated) exchanges. \nSecond, if users transfer assets directly to other users, that eliminates the need to transfer assets to the exchange, thereby reducing the risk of theft from hacks and other fraud. \nOn the other hand, decentralized exchanges (like all cryptocurrency exchanges) must maintain a fundamental level of user interest in the form of trading volume and liquidity. Not all decentralized exchanges have been able to achieve these important baseline qualities. Further, users of a decentralized exchange may have less recourse if they are the victims of fraud than those who use regulated ones. \nMaking deposits and withdrawals comes at a price, depending on the payment method chosen to transfer funds. Exchanges may charge higher fees based on the risk of chargebacks if they accept credit or debit cards. \nIn addition to transaction fees and fund transfer fees, traders may have to pay currency conversion fees, depending on the currencies that are accepted by the Bitcoin exchange. If a user transfers Canadian dollars to an exchange that only deals in U.S. dollars, the bank or the exchange will convert the CAD to USD for a fee. Transacting with an exchange that accepts your local currency is the best way to avoid the FX fee. \nNearly all Bitcoin exchanges have applied to each completed buy and sell order carried out within the exchange. The fee rate depends on the volume of Bitcoin transactions conducted on the network. \nNote that a Bitcoin exchange is different from a Bitcoin wallet. While the former offers a platform through which bitcoin buyers and sellers can transact with each other, the latter is simply a digital storage service for bitcoin holders to store their private crypto keys securely. Most Bitcoin exchanges provide wallets for their users but may charge a fee for this service. \nSimilar to stock and commodity exchanges, online Bitcoin marketplaces usually designate Bitcoin participants as market or . A market maker is a trader who always tries to buy and sell at the best ask and bid, and a market taker tries to execute their trades immediately. Takers are more concerned with liquidity and quick trades. \nA trader initiates a market order to buy 10 bitcoins and fill their order at the price of $2,265.75. However, only five bitcoins are available at the best ask, and 10 coins are available for $2,269.55. The trader's order will be filled with five coins at $2,265.75 and the remaining five at $2,269.55. \nHowever, a trader who thinks they can get Bitcoin for a better price could set a limit order for $2,260.10. If a seller matches their ask price with this order or sets a price below this figure, the order will get filled. All of this is done by the exchange, which takes a percentage of each transaction for their business. \nThere are many Bitcoin exchanges, but the safest ones are those that are registered in the countries they operate in and regulated by the appropriate agencies. However, even this isn't a guarantee of 100% safety—it only ensures that you have a better chance of being protected if something were to happen.\nYes. There are several ways to do this. You can use an online exchange account linked to your bank account or find a cryptocurrency ATM near you that will cash your Bitcoin. However, cryptocurrency ATMs have exorbitant fees in addition to the transaction fees owed to the cryptocurrency network.\nBitcoin exchanges are online platforms that connect cryptocurrency buyers and sellers. They also provide other services, but what they offer depends on customer demand, local regulations, and if the service can be provided. \nCould you be getting more from your CFD trading? with razor-sharp spreads, low commission and deep liquidity.

Therefore, it is imperative to save the private key in a secure location. \nKey storage falls into two types, each with two wallet types. Custodial wallets let someone else, like an exchange, store your keys, while noncustodial wallets let you store your own. Both have cold wallets (offline) and hot wallets (online). \nCoinbase's storage is an example of a custodial cold wallet, from which you move keys to your Coinbase for use. The Ledger Nano X is a noncustodial cold wallet, connecting to a device with your chosen software wallet, a noncustodial hot wallet. \nYour private key is generated by your wallet and is used to create your public key (your wallet address) using encryption. You can view your private key using your wallet.\nA private key is a randomly generated number usually presented in 64-digit hexadecimal form.

For example, its price increased from around $6,000 in March 2020 to over $63,000 in April 2021, then dropped nearly 50% in the next two months. It often fluctuates over 10% in just a few hours. \nThis volatility appeals to traders but makes everyday transactions risky for buyers and sellers. Investors holding cryptocurrencies for long-term appreciation don't want to become famous for paying . Similarly, most merchants don't want to lose money if the price of a cryptocurrency plunges after they get paid in it. \nFor a currency that isn't legal tender to work as a medium of exchange, it must stay relatively stable to ensure short-term purchasing power. In traditional fiat exchange, even 1% daily movements are rare. \nThe offers that appear in this table are from partnerships from which Investopedia receives compensation.

While most auditors are trustworthy, auditing introduces another third party into a system meant to minimize third-party involvement.\nSome argue that stablecoins are unnecessary because the U.S. dollar is widely accepted. Others believe digital currencies not controlled by are the future. With that in mind, four types of stablecoins, based on the assets used to stabilize their value, have been created. \nTether (USDT) and TrueUSD () are popular stablecoins backed by U.S. dollar reserves and denominated at parity to the dollar. As of December 2025, Tether (USDT) was the third-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, worth more than $184 billion. \nFor example, commodity-backed token Tether Gold (XAUt) is a cryptocurrency backed by gold reserves. The gold is thought to be held by an unnamed custodian in Switzerland, as the terms of service state: \n> \"A Gold Token holder who has effectuated redemption can elect to receive physical delivery of their gold bar at a place of their choosing, acting reasonably, in Switzerland (subject to the payment of fees in accordance with the Gold Token Fee Schedule in effect at the time of redemption).\" \nCrypto-collateralized stablecoins are backed by other cryptocurrencies. Because the may also be prone to high volatility, such stablecoins are generally overcollateralized—that is, the value of cryptocurrency held in reserves exceeds the value of the stablecoins issued. \nCryptocurrencies worth $2 million might be held as a reserve to issue $1 million in a crypto-backed stablecoin, insuring against a 50% decline in the price of the reserve cryptocurrency. For example, MakerDAO's Dai () stablecoin is pegged to the U.S. dollar but is backed by Ethereum (ETH) and other cryptocurrencies worth about 100.5% of the DAI stablecoin in circulation. \nAlgorithmic stablecoins may or may not hold reserve assets. Their primary distinction is the strategy of keeping the stablecoin's value stable by controlling its supply through an algorithm, essentially a computer program running a preset formula. \nIn some ways, that's not so different from central banks, which also don't rely on a reserve asset to keep the value of the currency they issue stable. The difference is that a central bank like the sets monetary policy publicly based on well-understood parameters, and its status as the issuer of legal tender does wonders for the credibility of that policy. \nAlgorithmic stablecoin issuers can't fall back on such advantages in a crisis. The price of the TerraUSD (UST) algorithmic stablecoin plunged more than 60% on May 11, 2022, vaporizing its peg to the U.S. dollar, as the price of the related slumped more than 80% overnight. \nStablecoins continue to be , given the rapid growth of the $290 billion market and its potential to affect the broader financial system. In October 2021, the and the Bank for International Settlements said stablecoins should be regulated as financial market infrastructure alongside payment systems and clearinghouses. Its proposed rules focus on stablecoins considered systemically important, those with the potential to disrupt payment and settlement transactions. \nUnder the Markets in Crypto Assets Regulation in Europe, which took effect in 2023, algorithmic stablecoins are strictly regulated. All others must have assets held in custody by a third party. Reserves must be liquid and have a 1:1 ratio of assets to coins. \nMoreover, U.S. politicians have increased calls for tighter regulation of stablecoins. In 2025, President Donald Trump signed the Genius Act into law, which requires stablecoin issuers to adhere to marketing rules, such as making misleading claims that their stablecoins are federally insured or legal tender. They must also publicly disclose the reserve composition every month as well as hold liquid assets like U.S. dollars or short-term Treasuries. \nStablecoins attempt to peg their market value to some external reference, usually a fiat currency. They are more useful than volatile cryptocurrencies as a medium of exchange. Stablecoins may be pegged to a currency like the U.S. dollar or the price of a commodity such as gold, or use an algorithm to control supply. They also maintain reserve assets as collateral or through algorithmic formulas that are supposed to control supply.\nThe most popular and largest stablecoin by market capitalization is Tether (USDT). It is pegged to the U.S. dollar at a 1:1 ratio and backed by reserves. It's also consistently in the top five cryptocurrencies by market cap. You can find Tether on most major crypto exchanges, including and Coinbase.\nStablecoins are cryptocurrencies with a peg to other assets, such as fiat currency or commodities held in reserve. The intent behind them is to create a crypto asset with much lower price volatility, which makes them better for use in transactions. \n_The comments, opinions, and analyses expressed on Investopedia are for informational purposes only.

      "markdown": "\n\nA crypto token represents an asset or stake and is built on an existing blockchain. While similar to cryptocurrencies, tokens are not the native assets of blockchains. They are pivotal in fundraising for projects through initial coin offerings (ICOs). However, the ICO landscape has seen both legitimate endeavors and scams, necessitating careful consideration by potential investors. \n\n\nBefore the 2017 ICO boom, there were cryptocurrencies that forked from Bitcoin and Ethereum. Mastercoin was the first recognized ICO and token. Mastercoin was created by J.R. Willet and announced on January 2012 via Bitcoin Forum. He titled his whitepaper \"The Second Bitcoin Whitepaper.\" \nMastercoin was one of the first projects to describe using layers to enhance a cryptocurrency's functionality. The project linked Mastercoin's value to Bitcoin and explained using funds to help developers create a way for users to make new coins from their Mastercoins. \nBetween 2012 and 2016, crypto token creation and ICO increased until 2017—token offerings skyrocketed as investors seemed to become aware of them and the possible increase in value they promised. Developers, businesses, and scammers rapidly created tokens to take advantage of the fundraising boom, prompting regulatory agencies to warn investors about ICO risks. \nThe offers that appear in this table are from partnerships from which Investopedia receives compensation. This compensation may impact how and where listings appear. Investopedia does not include all offers available in the marketplace.\nIn 2018, the ICO bubble burst, and shortly after, initial exchange offerings (IEO) emerged where exchanges started facilitating token offerings. Exchanges claimed to vet token offerings to reduce risks for investors, but scammers still used them to promote scams. \nRegulatory agencies issued alerts to investors about the risks involved in participating in an IEO; they also alerted exchanges that they were required to register with the authorities if they were facilitating these fund-raising efforts. The logic was that the exchanges might be acting as alternative trading systems or broker/dealers, which by law are required to register. \nCrypto tokens continue to be created and used to raise funds for projects via ICOs. Whitepapers read like pitchbooks, outlining the token's purpose, how it will be sold, how the funds will be used, and how investors will benefit. \n  * , it might need to be registered. In the United States, the SEC considers tokens securities and requires them to be registered unless they qualify for an exemption. \n  * Look at the team behind the ICO and their backgrounds. Determine if they are a legitimate business by checking the address and phone numbers, and visit the website of the Secretary of State for the state they claim to be registered in and search for them. If you can't find information about it other than in a white paper and custom website, it might be a scam.\n  * ICOs from outside of the U.S. might be difficult to research. One such token was BananaCoin, issued as a fundraiser for banana plantations in Laos. Investors were told they could exchange their tokens for an equal value of bananas or funds after launch. \n  * Many crypto tokens are listed on non-regulated exchanges outside of the United States. If it isn't listed on a regulated exchange, the odds of it being a scam are much higher.\n\n\nCrypto or cryptography refers to the various encryption and cryptographic techniques that safeguard crypto tokens and currencies, such as elliptical curve encryption, public-private key pairs, and hashing functions. Cryptocurrencies, on the other hand, are virtual currencies on a blockchain. These systems allow for secure online payments and storing of value. \nBlockchain companies or projects create crypto tokens as transactional units on existing blockchains. They are created using standard templates like that of the network. Such blockchains work on the concept of or , wherein the programmable, self-executing code is used to process and manage the various transactions that occur. \nA smart contract is a self-executing program that automates transactions. Two parties agree on terms. Then code is written to execute the transaction once the agreed upon terms are met.\nFor example, you might receive a crypto token representing a certain number of customer loyalty points on a blockchain that manages such details for a retail chain. Another crypto token might give the token holder the entitlement to view 10 hours of streaming content on a video-sharing blockchain. A token can even represent other cryptocurrencies, such as a crypto token equalling 15 bitcoins on a particular blockchain. Such crypto tokens are tradable and transferrable among the various participants of the blockchain \nInvestors can use crypto tokens for any number of reasons. They can hold onto them to represent a in the cryptocurrency company or for an economic reason—to trade or make purchases of goods and services. As a practical example, decentralized storage provider Bluzelle allows you to stake your to help secure its network while earning transaction fees and rewards. \nThe continues to issue alerts about cryptocurrency and token fraud, so be sure you research before investing in any cryptocurrency—the same way you would with any stock.\nA cryptocurrency is used for making or receiving payments using a blockchain, with the most popular cryptocurrency being (). Altcoins are alternative cryptocurrencies that were launched after the massive success achieved by Bitcoin. The term means alternative coins—that is—cryptocurrency other than Bitcoin. They were launched as enhanced Bitcoin substitutes that have claimed to overcome some of Bitcoin's pain points. (), (), , and () are typical examples of altcoins. Though each has tasted varying levels of success, none have managed to gain popularity akin to Bitcoin's. \nWhile cryptocurrencies have their own blockchain and are its native asset, crypto tokens are built on an existing blockchain, which acts as a medium for the creation and execution of decentralized apps and smart contracts. The tokens are used to facilitate on the blockchain. In many cases, tokens go through an ICO and then transistion to this stage after the ICO completes. \nCrypto tokens generally facilitate transactions on a blockchain but can represent an investor's stake in a company or serve an economic purpose, similar to . However, tokens are not legal tender. This means token holders can use them to make purchases or trades just like other securities to make a profit.\nThe main difference is that crypto coins have their own independent blockchain, whereas tokens are built on an existing blockchain. Crypto coins are designed to be used as currency, while crypto tokens are intended to represent an interest in an asset and facilitate transactions on a blockchain.\nCrypto tokens represent digital assets or interests built on existing blockchains, facilitating transactions and project funding. Unlike cryptocurrencies, which are native to their blockchains, tokens are created through processes like ICOs, often serving as fundraising tools. While ICOs offer legitimate funding opportunities, they have also been exploited for scams. Before investing in crypto tokens, thoroughly research the issuing team or company to avoid potential fraud. \n_Cryptocurrency and ICO investments carry substantial risks and uncertainties.

      "markdown": "\n\nGas fees on the Ethereum blockchain are essential for conducting transactions and executing contracts. Priced in gwei, smaller fractions of Ethereum's cryptocurrency, ETH, these fees compensate validators for the resources expended during transaction processing. The price of gas fluctuates based on supply, demand, and network capacity, making it a competitive and dynamic component of Ethereum's operation. \n\n\nGas fees rise and fall in response to supply and demand for transactions—if the network is congested, gas prices may be high. On the other hand, they could be low if there is not much traffic. \nThe offers that appear in this table are from partnerships from which Investopedia receives compensation. This compensation may impact how and where listings appear. Investopedia does not include all offers available in the marketplace.\nInitially, gas fees were determined by the gas limit and price per unit. In August 2021, changed its calculations for gas fees to use a base fee (a set fee for the transaction set by the network), units of gas required, and a priority fee. The priority fee is a tip to the validator that chooses a transaction—the more you tip, the higher the chances are that your transaction will be processed faster. \nSo, imagine you wanted to pay a friend 2 ETH, and you think it will require two units of gas. The base fee is 11 gwei, and you provide a tip of 3 gwei. Your gas fee would be: \nEthereum, as a platform and system, is designed to be used by others to create more use cases for and cryptocurrency. For this reason, it is commonly called the Ethereum Virtual Machine, because applications can be created that run on it. The EVM is essentially a large virtual computer, like an application in the cloud, that runs other blockchain-based applications within it. \nThe EVM has been used to create many , cryptocurrencies, and tokens. These require gas fees because they operate on the Ethereum blockchain. Because the Ethereum blockchain is part of the EVM, the cryptocurrencies built on that blockchain require gas fees. For example, a popular token built on Ethereum's blockchain is DAI. Because it uses the Ethereum blockchain, users need to pay gas fees in gwei to conduct transactions on the chain. \nAn ongoing concern for any cryptocurrency that requires transaction fees is the price users pay for the transactions. Before 2020, Ethereum's gas fees were usually just a few cents, but often spiked. After January 2020, they rose significantly, frequently exceeding $20, as more users joined. \nAfter —the merge of the Beacon Chain and the Ethereum main chain when proof-of-stake was implemented—fees began to range from a few dollars to as high as $30. However, The Merge was not designed to address the problem of high fees. It was one of many updates that, when combined, are believed to eventually lower gas fees. \nThere are ways to avoid high fees. First, try timing your transactions during less busy periods on the network. EtherScan provides a gas tracker that shows the day's high, low, and average gas fees, so you can try to time your necessary transactions using its tracker or another like it. The website also provides a Chrome extension you can install to the browser that lets you see gas prices in real time. \nSecond, you can use Layer 2 solutions or dApps for your transactions. Taking your activity off the main chain is one of the best ways to keep your fees low. \nEthereum gas is a blockchain transaction fee paid to network validators for their services to the blockchain. Without the fees, there would be no incentive for anyone to stake their ETH and help secure the network.\nThe Ethereum gas fee exists to pay network validators for their work securing the blockchain and network. Without the fees, there would be few reasons to stake ETH and become a validator. The network would be at risk without validators and the work they do. So, it essentially runs on gas.\nGas fees are used on the Ethereum blockchain and network to incentivize users to stake their ETH. Staking works to secure the blockchain because it discourages dishonest behavior. For staking their ETH, owners are given small payments as a reward for helping to secure the blockchain and help it function. \nFees are determined by the amount of network traffic, the supply of validators, and the demand for transaction verification. The higher the demand and traffic, the higher the fees. When traffic and demand are lower, fees become lower. \nDid you know that 82% of Nvidia’s gains between March 2024 and February 2025 happened outside of regular Nasdaq hours?* on 100+ US shares 24 hours a day, meaning you never need to miss out when the markets move. for super-fast execution backed by dedicated support. 74-89% of retail CFD accounts lose money *Data from the Pepperstone platform. \nInvestopedia requires writers to use primary sources to support their work.

At the very least, you should have enough before investing funds into crypto. Once you're ready to invest, you should make crypto no more than 5% of . This is enough to gain exposure to potential gains while limiting the impact of losses on the overall portfolio. \nUse for crypto, which involves making small, recurring purchases on a set schedule, such as weekly or monthly.

As a result of the trend of continuous price increases, the value of the assets you buy will rise over time, reducing the impact of volatility. \nVetting a crypto investment involves different metrics from the stock market. These often include assessing real-world adoption potential, reviewing technical specifications, studying the founders and developers, scanning community engagement, and evaluating competitors. \nFavor projects that have been time-tested or that offer unique capabilities not easily copied and have the promise of widespread adoption. Beware of assets tied solely to speculation . \nCrucial fundamentals to research are the utility of the token, the speed and scalability of transactions, the security of the network, the transparency and experience of the team, and the competitive advantages it has over competing cryptocurrencies. \nLarge, established crypto assets like Bitcoin and Ethereum enjoy first-mover and adoption benefits, have large market capitalization, and are tied to a series of financial products built on top of them, such as ETFs and derivatives markets. These well-known coins have weathered and downturns. \nWhile risks remain, bigger cryptocurrencies (by market cap and trading volume) have generally demonstrated their resilience, unlike newer or smaller-cap coins. However, if the chance arises, consider rebalancing periodic profit-taking from major assets into promising newer projects with real-world utility. As with any particular asset or security, major cryptos relative to your overall investment portfolio size and risk tolerance. \nStore sizable crypto holdings in a or with a rather than leaving them on an exchange long-term.

Do not electronically store your recovery phrase; if you must, encrypt or password-protect it. Be careful when entering sensitive wallet data on devices. Use complex and unique passwords, seed phrases, and secure backups. \nStay objective when . Do not fall prey to the , , or hype cycles. Also, avoid any assets with promises of easy money, guaranteed returns, or anything that sounds too good to be true. Invariably, it is. \nMaintain a balanced portfolio across multiple asset classes. Don't be overexposed to crypto. Vet any for accuracy before acting on it. Understand that crypto investing remains highly speculative, and be ready to if investment trends change. \nPut aside time to learn about the underlying tech powering different crypto assets. Knowing how networks, (e.g., ), hashing algorithms, and work will give you better insight into a project's prospects. \nLearning cryptography basics also helps you better grasp the potential of products like . Subscribe to legitimate industry publications and blogs independent of the crypto you invest in and stay up-to-date on new technological developments in the space. \nFollow relevant legal cases and regulatory developments, as well as legislative proposals related to crypto, both domestically and abroad. Major regulations can significantly affect prices and adoption. For example, when China banned , many miners moved their operations. Stay on top of enacted by blockchain projects and the posturing of politicians and their promises. These can substantially alter staking yields, development funding, and other dynamics. \nWhile crypto's volatility makes accurate predictions impossible, tried-and-true like , relative strength, and crossovers can provide valuable signals. Moving average crossovers, for instance, may identify . Crypto-specific indicators like , mempool size, average transaction fees, addresses by time held, and so on are also important. \nAssessing indicators can help you better time your entries and exits.

      "markdown": "\n\n\n\nWith the price of Bitcoin reaching a new all-time high of $126,198.07 in October 2025, new investors may be seeking to research the digital asset to determine if it aligns with their investing style and financial goals. \nInvesting in Bitcoin (BTCUSD) can seem complicated, but it isn't. It only requires an account with a service provider or a as well as a secure way to store your purchases. \nBitcoin investors need a cryptocurrency exchange account, personal identification documents if they are using a Know Your Client (KYC) platform, a secure connection to the internet, a method of payment, and a personal outside the exchange account. \nPrivacy and security are important issues for Bitcoin users. Investors who gain the to a public address can authorize transactions. The private key is a cryptographic code similar to a password that allows a user to transfer cryptocurrencies from their wallet on the Bitcoin blockchain. Private keys should be kept secret, and investors must be aware that the balance of a public address is visible. \nIndividuals can create multiple public addresses and distribute their collection of Bitcoin over many addresses. A good strategy is to keep significant investments at public addresses that aren't directly connected to those used in transactions. \nThe history of transactions made on the blockchain is transparent, but identifying user information isn't. On the Bitcoin blockchain, only a user's public key appears next to a transaction, making transactions confidential but not anonymous. \nThe offers that appear in this table are from partnerships from which Investopedia receives compensation. This compensation may impact how and where listings appear. Investopedia does not include all offers available in the marketplace.\nBitcoin transactions are more traceable than cash transactions because they are available for public viewing. However, it is very difficult to determine who is transacting unless the address is associated with an exchange account, which is required if the user wants to convert their Bitcoin to fiat currency. \nThis is because when you create an account on a regulated exchange that can convert cryptocurrency, you must provide identification. This is called and is required by law in many countries to assist anti-money laundering and anti-terrorism financing efforts. \nExchanges are a convenient option because they offer a breadth of features and more cryptocurrencies for trading. Exchanges also enable investors to buy, sell, and hold cryptocurrency and allow users to transfer crypto to their online wallet for safekeeping. \nPopular exchanges in the U.S. and many other countries are centralized and follow laws that require users to submit identifying documentation. These exchanges include Coinbase, Kraken, Gemini, and Binance; they offer Bitcoin, a growing number of , and fiat exchange services. \nDepending on the exchange, personal identification can be required, which may mean that you have to include a picture of a driver's license or Social Security card, as well as information about your employer and source of funds. The process is largely the same as setting up a typical . \nAt most centralized exchanges, you can connect your bank account directly or link it to a debit or credit card. Although you can use a credit card to purchase cryptocurrency, cryptocurrency price volatility could inflate the overall cost of purchasing a token when combined with a credit card's interest charges. \nCryptocurrency exchanges have evolved and now mimic the same features as their traditional brokerage counterparts. Crypto exchanges offer several order types and ways to invest or trade. Almost all crypto exchanges offer both and , and some also provide stop-loss orders. \nExchanges also offer ways to set up recurring investments, allowing clients to dollar-cost average their investments of choice. Coinbase, for example, lets users set weekly, biweekly, or monthly recurring purchases. \nCryptocurrency wallets are a place to store digital asset keys. Keeping crypto keys off an exchange and in a non-connected wallet (cold wallet) ensures that users have control over the keys. Investors can use the wallets offered by exchanges, but it's not recommended for large or long-term cryptocurrency holdings. \nHot wallet holders who haven't created enough security run the risk of losing funds to theft. Strong passwords, two-factor authentication, anti-virus programs, and safe Internet browsing should be considered minimum requirements. \nHot wallets are best for small amounts of cryptocurrency or cryptocurrency that is actively trading on an exchange. Another use is like a checking account, only placing what you need for certain transactions in your hot wallet. \nSome come with software that allows investors to view their portfolios without putting their private keys at risk. Types of cold wallets are paper, hardware, or even metal stamped with private keys. \nA paper wallet is simply a piece of paper with private keys written on it. Some people laminate these paper wallets and store them in safe deposit boxes at their bank or even in a safe in their home. \nYou can buy Bitcoin through a payment processor like PayPal Holdings Inc. There are two ways to purchase Bitcoin using PayPal: You can connect your account to a debit card or bank account, or use the balance of the PayPal account to buy cryptocurrencies from a third-party provider. \nYou may also use PayPal to directly buy seven cryptocurrencies: Bitcoin, Ethereum, , Solana, Chainlink, , and PayPal's own stablecoin, PayPal USD. U.S. residents can use their existing PayPal accounts or set up a new one to buy Bitcoin. You can also use your cryptocurrencies to buy products and services. \nWhen you buy Bitcoin directly from PayPal, it earns money from the crypto spread, or \"the difference between the highest buy order and the lowest sell order on any exchange.\" PayPal also charges a transaction fee for each purchase, which depends on the dollar amount purchased. \nYou can send crypto, including Bitcoin, from PayPal to an external digital asset wallet that you own and control, or to one owned and controlled by another person, like a friend or family member. To send your Bitcoin outside of PayPal, you must provide the wallet address where you want to send the assets. If you send Bitcoin, you must use a wallet that accepts it. \nThe social trading and multi-asset investment company eToro is among the few online traders that allow Bitcoin purchases using PayPal. \nUsing credit cards to buy Bitcoin is similar to using debit cards or transfers. However, not all exchanges allow you to buy Bitcoin with credit cards due to associated processing fees and the risk of fraud. \nCredit card processing can add extra charges to these transactions. In addition to paying blockchain transaction fees, the exchange may pass on processing fees to the buyer. Credit card issuers treat Bitcoin purchases like cash advances and charge hefty fees and interest rates on them. \nact like in-person Bitcoin exchanges. Individuals can insert cash into a machine and use it to purchase Bitcoin, which gets transferred to their wallet. Bitcoin ATMs have become increasingly popular in recent years and are even available at the retail giant Walmart Inc. (WMT), among other places. \nTwo charges are associated with ATM Bitcoin purchases: a purchase fee and a conversion fee for converting a fiat currency to Bitcoin. Both fees are fairly steep compared with those of other options. For example, CoinHub charges a markup of 12.5% and a retailer fee of $4.95 above the Bitstamp spot rate. \nAlthough P2P exchanges don't offer the same anonymity as decentralized exchanges, they give users the chance to shop around for the best deal. Many of these exchanges also provide rating systems so that users can evaluate potential trade partners before transacting. \nRobinhood Markets is an exchange that offers crypto trading. It charges a 0.03% to 0.85% fee for crypto trades and purchases. The fees are based on the trailing 30-day trading volume of crypto orders executed with smart exchange routing. If investors use market maker routing, then the fee is $0.85 for every $100 notional crypto order. Robinhood has enabled trading on its platform for these assets, which include Bitcoin, Bitcoin Cash, Litecoin, Ethereum, , and Ethereum Classic. \nBitcoin and other crypto investments aren't protected by insurance from the . At regular , the agency protects against the loss of securities and cash in brokerage accounts containing up to $500,000, with a $250,000 cash limit.\nYou can sell Bitcoin at the same venues where you purchased the cryptocurrency, such as cryptocurrency exchanges and P2P platforms. Typically, the process of selling Bitcoin on these platforms is similar to the process of buying it. \nMost crypto exchanges charge a percentage of the sale amount as fees. For example, Coinbase says it may charge a fee when a customer cashes out their crypto, depending on the payment method selected. \nExchanges generally have daily and monthly withdrawal limits. Therefore, cash from a large sale may not be immediately available to the trader. But with Coinbase, for example, there is no limit on the amount of cryptocurrency you can sell. \nIt is possible that $100 in Bitcoin today might turn into $200 or more in the future, but it is just as likely that it will turn into $1. Bitcoin is very volatile, so you should consider your financial circumstances before investing to determine if you can afford to lose the money you invest.\nBuying Bitcoin can seem complicated if you haven't done it, but it's relatively simple. It just requires an account at a service or an exchange and a way to store your purchases safely. \nEach of these steps requires research and a careful assessment of the pros and cons of the relevant service.

      "title": "Are There Taxes on Bitcoin?",
      "markdown": "Even though was introduced in 2009, there is still considerable confusion about its taxes. Cryptocurrency was conceived as a medium for daily transactions but has yet to gain widespread traction as a currency. Meanwhile, it has become popular with speculators and traders interested in making a quick buck off its volatility. \nThe addressed cryptocurrency transactions in its notice 2014-21. The agency stated that cryptocurrencies would be treated as assets similar to property. In 2020, the IRS began including a question on its to determine whether the taxpayer had any cryptocurrency transactions during the given tax year. \nDepending on the type of transaction, assets are subject to various kinds of taxes. However, the unique characteristics and use cases for Bitcoin mean that there are many exceptions with continually evolving tax legislation. \n\n\nBitcoin is an idea, a token of ownership of a certain value amount. Its value is determined by its market price on the day it is bought or sold—this price changes, sometimes by the minute. \nIt is treated by users as a medium of exchange, investors as a store of value, and traders as a means to profit from price movements. In the U.S., it is taxed as property by the IRS. \nBecause they are property, Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies are assets that require tax reporting when specific actions are taken. Depending on when and how someone acquires and uses cryptocurrency, they could be subject to capital gains or income taxes. \nThe offers that appear in this table are from partnerships from which Investopedia receives compensation. This compensation may impact how and where listings appear. Investopedia does not include all offers available in the marketplace.\nWhen you sell a virtual currency you've held for more than one year, you must recognize capital gains or losses on the sale. Any gain or loss is calculated based on the cryptocurrency's market value on the day and time you bought it (its basis). \nThe gains or losses recognized are subject to limitations on the deductibility of the taxpayer's capital losses. This tax legislation is determined by IRS Publication 544 (Sales and Other Dispositions of Assets). Capital gains are reported on of a taxpayer's Form 1040. \nIn the broadest sense, gains and losses on the sale of Bitcoin are treated the same as other capital assets such as stocks, bonds, precious metals, or certain personal property, Short-term capital gains are taxed as ordinary income and assessed at the same tax rate as the taxpayer's salary or wages. Long-term capital gains are taxed at a rate that varies on the taxpayer's income. \nThe IRS has provided specific guidance on transactions involving digital assets that are to be included in a tax return. Note that the extent of these transactions may make for difficulty when tracking all transactions; cryptocurrency investors and users are advised to seek tax advisor guidance to ensure all of the following transactions are adequately being reported: \n\n\nIn its broadest sense, the tax basis of Bitcoin used to determine your gain or loss is the cost for which the digital currency was obtained or its market price at the time it was acquired. For example, assume you acquired 100,000 when Bitcoin traded at $20,000/coin. The cost basis of the acquisition would be $20. \nIn the example above, should the Bitcoin be sold for $25 more than one year later, a $5 taxable capital gain would occur. If the Bitcoin were sold for $14, a $6 loss would occur. If you sold it for $25 six months later, $5 in taxable income would need to be reported. \nThe tax basis of Bitcoin becomes more complicated as less straightforward transactions occur. For example, an investor may receive airdropped tokens or tokens in exchange for a service at no cost. In most of these situations, the airdropped digital currencies would have a basis equal to the fair market value at the time of acquisition. This tax treatment is similar to that of stocks and bonds. \nCryptocurrency mining is also considered a taxable event. The fair market value or cost basis of the coin is its price at the time at which it was rewarded to you. The nature of those deductions differs based on whether you mined the cryptocurrencies for personal or business gain. \nIf you run a mining business, then you can make the deductions to cut down your tax bill. But you cannot make these deductions if you mined the cryptocurrencies for personal benefit. \nSome have argued that conversion of one cryptocurrency to another, say from Bitcoin to Ether, should be classified as a under Section 1031 of the . The IRS allows you to defer income tax on exchanges of like-kind property when they are exchanged for productive use in a business or investment. \nHowever, in a Memorandum from the Office of Chief Counsel released on June 18, 2021, the IRS ruled that such exchanges do not qualify as a like-kind exchange under Section 1031. What's more, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA) of 2017 put an end to that practice by clarifying that like-kind transfers are restricted to property transactions. \nIf you receive cryptocurrency in a transaction performed via an exchange, the value of the digital currency received is recorded by the exchange at the time of the transaction. If the transaction is performed outside of the exchange (P2P), the basis of the cryptocurrency is the fair market value at the time. \nHard forks of a cryptocurrency occur when a blockchain split occurs, meaning there is a change in protocols. This creates a taxable event if new cryptocurrencies are acquired because of it. For instance, imagine a blockchain was split, and a new coin, with differences in mining and use cases, was created. Holders of the original cryptocurrency are given new coins. This practice is called an airdrop and is also used as a marketing tactic by developers of new coins to induce demand and usage. \nIn a 2019 ruling, the IRS clarified that hard forks do not result in gross income, if the wallet holder does not receive units of cryptocurrency. Airdrops, on the other hand, qualify as gross income after the holder receives units of a new cryptocurrency either after a hard fork or by marketers of a coin. In the latter case, the quantity and time at which a crypto wallet holder receives the new coins determines the tax amount. Airdrops are taxed as ordinary income. \nA critical note here is the coins' value when you receive them. A new coin might be forked from Bitcoin, with the developers stating it has a certain value. However, just because the creators state this doesn't mean the airdropped crypto was worth it—it is worth whatever its fair market value was on that day because it is no longer Bitcoin, and cryptocurrency creators of non-security tokens do not dictate market value. A would likely be issued with a value because you're buying an asset being issued like a stock.\nCryptocurrency donations are treated similarly to cash donations. They are tax-deductible, though donors face limits on how much they can deduct based on their adjusted gross income. An appraiser will assign a fair market value for the coin based on its market price at the time of donation. The donor is not required to pay any taxes on the price gain. \nThe IRS established an annual . In 2023, taxpayers were allowed an annual exclusion per donee for a gift amount of up to $17,000. This limit was increased to $18,000 in 2024. \nThe volatility of Bitcoin's price makes it difficult to determine the fair value of the cryptocurrency on purchase and sale transactions. You should always track transactions as they occur, as retrospectively needing to obtain financial information (even on distributed ledgers) may prove to be difficult. \nThe only way to avoid paying Bitcoin taxes is to not sell or use any during the tax year. Receiving Bitcoin as an airdrop or in exchange for service has tax implications, but most taxable events are triggered by the sale or exchange of the cryptocurrency.\nAll centralized exchanges have \"Know Your Client\" reporting obligations in which investors must upload their photo identification and some personal information. If your trading platform provides you with a Form 1099-B or Form 1099-K, the IRS is informed that you have transacted with the trading platform.\nTax evasion occurs when taxpayers knowingly fail to report and pay taxes on any source of income, whether related to cryptocurrency, wages, salaries, stocks, real estate, or other investments. If the IRS has reason to believe you have engaged in tax fraud, it may audit you. Be mindful that trading platforms may issue tax statements notifying the IRS that you have engaged in cryptocurrency transactions.\nMost transactions trigger taxable events, and your Bitcoin's tax basis is usually the cost basis or fair market value at acquisition. Knowingly avoiding reporting income or gains is considered tax fraud. \nDid you know that 82% of Nvidia’s gains between March 2024 and February 2025 happened outside of regular Nasdaq hours?* on 100+ US shares 24 hours a day, meaning you never need to miss out when the markets move. for super-fast execution backed by dedicated support. 74-89% of retail CFD accounts lose money *Data from the Pepperstone platform. \nInvestopedia requires writers to use primary sources to support their work.
