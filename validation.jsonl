Paper wallets, which are pieces of paper with a written or printed code, are considered outdated and unreliable.\n\n\nA crypto wallet is a tool that allows you to interact with blockchain networks to manage your cryptocurrencies and other digital assets. Your crypto wallet keeps track of how much cryptocurrency you have and lets you send and receive digital assets.\nIn addition to storing and managing your cryptocurrency, crypto wallets also allow you to connect to decentralized applications (DApps), such as decentralized exchanges (DEXs) and play-to-earn games. You will also need a crypto wallet to store and manage non-fungible tokens (\nContrary to popular belief, crypto wallets don't actually store digital assets. Instead, they provide the tools necessary to access and spend your crypto holdings. In other words, crypto wallets generate the necessary information to send and receive assets via \nas a “specific location\" on the blockchain to which coins can be sent. Similar to how you share your email address with others to receive messages, you can share your wallet’s public address with others to receive funds.\nregardless of which wallet you use. So, even if your computer or smartphone is lost, you can still access your funds on another device — as long as you have the appropriate private key or \nare managed by third parties, such as crypto exchanges, which store and manage the private keys on your behalf. These wallets prioritize convenience, allowing you to recover funds more easily if you forget your password or lose access. However, custodial wallets require trust in the custodian’s security and reliability because you won’t be fully in control of your assets.\n, on the other hand, grant you full control over your seed phrases and private keys, ensuring complete ownership of your cryptocurrency. This independence enhances security and privacy but comes with greater responsibility. If your keys are lost or compromised, recovery is nearly impossible.\nCrypto wallets are essential tools for the secure storage and management of digital assets. The non-custodial types provide users with full control, ownership, and direct access to their funds, promoting financial independence and eliminating the need for intermediaries.\nUnlike traditional financial systems where banks or intermediaries store your funds for you, non-custodial crypto wallets give you full control to store and manage your own money. You hold the private keys that serve as proof of ownership and allow you to authorize transactions.\ntransactions, which can be advantageous in terms of speed and cost efficiency. It also allows individuals in underbanked or unbanked regions to access financial services and participate in the global economy.\nCrypto wallets allow you to access your funds anytime, anywhere, as long as you have an Internet connection. You can send and receive cryptocurrency, check your balance, and interact with DApps at all times. This accessibility is especially useful for individuals who are unbanked, want to take control of their finances or participate in the \nCrypto wallets are often compatible with multiple cryptocurrencies and blockchain networks. This interoperability allows you to manage various digital assets within a single interface. You can trade a wide range of cryptocurrencies, participate in \nCrypto wallets play an important role in driving the adoption and use of cryptocurrencies by providing a tool for individuals to engage with the crypto space. They aim to simplify the complex aspects of cryptocurrencies, making it easier for individuals, including non-technical users, to understand and manage their digital assets. User-friendly wallets attract newcomers to the crypto space, facilitating their entry into the ecosystem.\nChoosing the best crypto wallet depends on several factors, including the user's specific needs and preferences. The best crypto wallet may also depend on the specific cryptocurrency you want to hold and use. \nFor example, the best Bitcoin wallet may be different from the one needed to store Ethereum-based assets. In some cases, the crypto wallet may not be designed for the blockchain network you’re interested in, so you may not even be able to use it. \nHardware wallets are electronic devices that use a random number generator (RNG) to generate public and private keys. The keys are then stored on the device itself. Hardware storage is a type of cold wallet, meaning that it operates offline and isn’t connected to the Internet when storing and signing cryptocurrency transactions.\nThis isolation from online networks enhances the security of the private keys and protects them from potential online threats, such as hacking or malware attacks. By keeping private keys offline, hardware wallets provide an additional layer of protection, making them the preferred choice for individuals seeking increased security for their digital assets.\nWhile these wallets provide a higher level of security against online attacks, even the best crypto hardware wallet can present risks if the firmware implementation isn’t done properly. Hardware wallets also tend to be less user-friendly. Depending on the wallet, funds might be more difficult to access when compared to hot wallets (the ones that are connected to the Internet).\nConsider using a hardware wallet if you plan to hold your assets for a long time or if you're holding large amounts of cryptocurrency. Currently, most hardware wallets allow you to set up a PIN code to protect your device and a recovery phrase as a backup in case you forget your PIN or lose your wallet device.\nSoftware wallets come in a variety of forms, including web, desktop, and mobile wallets. They offer convenience and accessibility, but most are hot wallets, meaning they are connected to the Internet in some way.\nYou can use web wallets to access blockchains through a browser interface without downloading or installing software to your device. This includes both exchange wallets and other browser-based wallet providers.\nWhen using a crypto exchange, you will have a custodial wallet that is managed by the company. While exchange wallets are more convenient for inexperienced users, you are entrusting the service provider with your keys and assets. So, it’s important to choose a trustworthy and secure provider like Binance.\nAs the name implies, desktop wallets are software applications that users download and run locally on their computers. Unlike some web-based versions, desktop wallets provide complete control over keys and funds. \nfile and keep it in a safe place. Alternatively, you can export and back up the corresponding private keys or wallet seed phrase. This will allow you to access your funds on other devices if your computer stops working or becomes inaccessible.\nIn general, reputable desktop wallets are considered secure. However, it’s crucial to ensure your computer is free of viruses and malware before setting up and using a desktop wallet. Electrum is a popular example of a desktop crypto wallet.\nMobile wallets work much like their web and desktop counterparts but are specifically designed as smartphone applications. These are quite convenient as they allow you to use crypto on the move. You can also send and receive digital assets using QR codes.\nis a piece of paper on which a crypto address and its private key are physically printed out. These wallets are highly resistant to online hacking attacks and may be considered an alternative to cold storage. However, they require careful handling and secure storage to prevent loss or damage.\nPaper wallets were relatively popular prior to 2016, but their use is now discouraged due to their intrinsic risks. Paper wallets are subject to being damaged or destroyed fairly easily. There are also security risks associated with data that might be stored in computers and printers after generating a paper wallet.\nAnother danger of using paper wallets comes from the misconception that funds can be sent multiple times from the same address. For instance, if you send 4 out of 10 BTC from your paper wallet, the remaining 6 BTC will be automatically transferred to a “change address” that is different from your paper wallet address. In most cases, users lose access to the remaining funds (the change) because it’s not an address they control.\nResearch different types of wallets and consider factors such as wallet security, compatibility, user experience, custody, and community trust. Look for reputable wallet providers and read reviews to make an informed decision.\nOnce you've chosen a wallet, visit the wallet provider's official website. Make sure you’re on a legitimate website by verifying the URL. This is important because there are fraudulent websites that look almost identical to the legitimate ones. \nIf you decide to go with a crypto hardware wallet, you should also ensure that the wallet is sealed when it arrives and the packaging hasn’t been tampered with. Ideally, you should buy hardware wallets directly from the manufacturer to reduce risks.\nIf it's a software wallet, find the download section on the website and select the appropriate version for your operating system. After downloading, follow the installation instructions provided by the wallet provider.\nIf you purchased a hardware wallet, you will need to follow the manufacturer's instructions to set it up. This usually involves connecting the device to your computer or smartphone using the included cable (or Bluetooth), installing the necessary software, and updating the firmware.\nWhen you first launch the wallet software, you'll usually have the option to create a new wallet or import an existing one. If setting up a new wallet, follow the instructions to generate a new wallet address and private key. If you already have a wallet, select the import option and provide the necessary details, like the recovery phrase or private key.\nRemember to back up your wallet at this stage to protect it from loss or damage. Follow the wallet provider's instructions to back up your wallet's recovery phrase or create a wallet backup file. Store this backup securely in a separate location.\nIt's important to prioritize the security of your crypto wallet. Set a strong password for the wallet software and enable any additional security features offered by the wallet provider, such as biometric or two-factor authentication (2FA).\nTake some time to play around and explore the wallet interface and its features. Familiarize yourself with functions such as sending and receiving funds, viewing transaction history, and accessing additional settings.\n  1. Go to your new wallet and get the public address. It’s often displayed along with a QR code. Copy the destination wallet address and paste it into the address field of your Binance withdrawal page.\n\n\nThere is no definitive answer. If you‘re a frequent trader, using a mobile or web wallet will allow you to access your funds quickly and trade conveniently. Assuming you have a virus-free device and secured your account with 2FA methods, your crypto is generally safe.\na large amount of crypto that you don’t plan to sell for a long time, cold wallets might be a better alternative, as they are more resistant to hacking, phishing attacks, and scams.\n_Disclaimer: This content is presented to you on an “as is” basis for general information and educational purposes only, without representation or warranty of any kind.

{"url": "https://academy.binance.com/en/articles/what-is-a-stablecoin", "title": "What Is a Stablecoin?", "markdown": "\n\nCryptocurrencies aren’t all about volatility. In fact, stablecoins are specifically designed to maintain a fixed price. In an industry where coins and tokens can crash overnight, there is a massive demand for currencies that mix blockchain benefits with the ability to track a more stable asset. If you haven’t started using stablecoins while trading or investing, it’s worth learning more about them as well as the benefits and drawbacks they bring.\nor other assets. For example, you can purchase tokens pegged to the dollar, euro, yen, and even gold and oil. A stablecoin allows the holder to lock in profits and losses and transfer value at a stable price on peer-to-peer blockchain networks.\nfor day-to-day payments. For example, merchants may take $5 in BTC for a coffee one day but find that their BTC is worth 50% less the next. This makes it challenging to plan and operate a business that accepts crypto payments.\nBefore, crypto investors and traders had no way to lock in a profit or avoid volatility without converting crypto back into fiat. The creation of stablecoins provided a simple solution to these issues. Today, you can easily get in and out of crypto volatility using stablecoins like TrueUSD (TUSD).\nA fiat-backed stablecoin keeps a fiat currency, such as USD or GBP, in reserves. For example, each TUSD is backed by $1 held as collateral. Users can then convert their fiat to a stablecoin and vice versa at the pegged rate.\nCrypto-backed stablecoins work in a similar way to fiat-backed stablecoins. But instead of using dollars or another currency as reserve, we have cryptocurrencies acting as collateral. As the crypto market is highly volatile, crypto-backed stablecoins usually over-collateralize the reserves as a measure against price swings.\nCrypto-backed stablecoins use smart contracts to manage minting and burning. This makes the process more reliable as users can independently audit the contracts. However, some crypto-backed stablecoins are run by \nLet’s look at an example. To mint 100 DAI pegged to USD, you will need to provide $150 of crypto as 1.5x collateral. Once you have your DAI, you can use it however you want. You could transfer it, invest it, or simply keep it as is. If you want your collateral back, you’ll need to pay back the 100 DAI. However, if your collateral drops below a certain collateral ratio or the loan’s value, it will be liquidated.\nWhen the stablecoin is below $1, incentives are created for holders to return their stablecoin for the collateral. This decreases the supply of the coin, causing the price to rise back to $1. When it’s above $1, users are incentivized to create the token, increasing its supply and lowering the price. DAI is just one example, but all crypto-backed stablecoins rely on a mix of \nEssentially, an algorithmic stablecoin system will reduce the token supply if the price falls below the fiat currency it tracks. This could be done via locked staking, burning, or buy-backs. If the price surpasses the value of the fiat currency, new tokens enter into circulation to reduce the stablecoin’s value.\nBusinesses, and individuals value stability. Due to its volatility, cryptocurrencies haven’t achieved widespread use for day-to-day payments. Large stablecoins have a track record for maintaining their peg, making them suitable for daily use.\na certain percentage of a portfolio to stablecoins is an effective way to reduce overall risk. Your portfolio as a whole will be more resistant to market price swings, and you will also have funds on hand in case a good opportunity comes up. You can also sell crypto for stablecoins during a market downturn and repurchase them at a lower price (i.e., \n. While some large projects have a good track record, there have also been many projects that have failed. When a stablecoin has constant issues maintaining its peg, it can lose its value dramatically.\nA central entity holds the collateral and may also be subject to external financial regulation. This gives them significant control over the coin. You also need to trust that the issuer has the reserves they claim to have. \nIt’s common to have open governance mechanisms in crypto projects, meaning that users get a say in the development and running of each project. As such, you need to get involved or trust the developers and community to run the project responsibly.\ncommunity that holds the governance token MKR. You can use MKR to create and vote on proposals to change the project. DAI is over-collateralized to deal with the volatility of crypto, and users enter into Collateralized Debt Positions (CDPs) that manage their collateral. The whole process is run via smart contracts.\nTUSD is an independently verifiable dollar-pegged stablecoin. It is the first stablecoin to programmatically control minting with instant on-chain verification of USD reserves held off-chain. TUSD's reserves are monitored using \nStablecoins have caught regulators’ interest worldwide due to their unique mix of fiat and crypto. As they are designed to maintain a stable price, they are useful for reasons other than speculation. They can also facilitate high-speed transactions internationally at a low cost. Some countries are even experimenting with creating their own stablecoins. As a stablecoin is a type of cryptocurrency, it will likely fall under the same regulations as crypto in your local jurisdiction. Issuing stablecoins with fiat reserves may also need regulatory approval.\nIt’s hard to find an investor or trader nowadays who hasn’t held a stablecoin at some point. Stablecoins are often held in crypto exchanges so that traders can quickly capitalize on new market opportunities. They're also very useful to enter and exit positions without having to cash out into fiat. Apart from trading and investing, stablecoins can be used for making payments and international transfers.\nEven though they are an integral part of crypto and have enabled the creation of a new financial system, you shouldn’t underestimate the risks. We’ve seen stablecoin projects with failing pegs, missing reserves, and lawsuits. So while stablecoins are incredibly versatile tools, do bear in mind that they're still cryptocurrencies and hold similar risks. You can mitigate risks by diversifying your portfolio, but make sure to do your own research before investing or trading, and don't invest more than you can afford to lose.\n_This content is presented to you on an “as is” basis for general information and educational purposes only, without representation or warranty of any kind.

But unlike a traditional contract, a smart contract’s terms are executed as code running on a blockchain like Ethereum. Smart contracts allow developers to build apps that take advantage of blockchain security, reliability, and accessibility while offering sophisticated peer-to-peer functionality — everything from loans and insurance to logistics and gaming.\nJust like any contract, smart contracts lay out the terms of an agreement or deal. What makes smart contracts “smart,” however, is that the terms are established and executed as code running on a blockchain, rather than on paper sitting on a lawyer’s desk. Smart contracts expand on the basic idea behind — sending and receiving money without a “trusted intermediary” like a bank in the middle — to make it possible to securely automate and decentralize virtually any kind of deal or transaction, no matter how complex. And because they run on a blockchain like , they offer , reliability, and borderless accessibility.\nSmart contracts allow developers to build a wide variety of decentralized apps and tokens. They’re used in everything from new financial tools to logistics and game experiences, and they’re stored on a blockchain like any other crypto transaction. Once a smart-contract app has been added to the blockchain, it generally can’t be reversed or changed (although there are some exceptions).\nSmart-contract-powered apps are often referred to as “decentralized applications” or “dapps” – and they include decentralized finance (or DeFi) tech that aims to transform the banking industry. allow cryptocurrency holders to engage in complex financial transactions — saving, loans, insurance — without a bank or other financial institution taking a cut and from anywhere in the world. Some of the more popular current smart-contract powered applications include:\n  * : A cryptocurrency that is pegged via smart contract to the US dollar, making one worth one U.S. dollar. UDDC is part of a newer category of digital money known as .\n\n\nSo how would you use these smart contract-powered tools? Imagine you’re holding some that you’d like to trade for . You could put some into , which, via smart contract, can automatically find you the best exchange rate, make the trade, and send you your USDC. You could then put some of your USDC into Compound to lend to others and receive an algorithmically determined rate of interest — all without using a bank or other financial institution. \nIn traditional finance, swapping currencies is expensive and time consuming. And it isn't easy or secure for individuals to loan out their liquid assets to strangers on the other side of the world. But smart contracts make both of those scenarios, and a vast variety of others, possible.\nSmart contracts were first in the 1990s by a computer scientist and lawyer named Nick Szabo. Szabo famously compared a smart contract to a vending machine. Imagine a machine that sells cans of soda for a quarter. If you put a dollar into the machine and select a soda, the machine is hardwired to either produce your drink and 75 cents in change, or (if your choice is sold out) to prompt you to make another selection or get your dollar back. This is an example of a simple smart contract. Just like a soda machine can automate a sale without a human intermediary, smart contracts can automate virtually any kind of exchange.\nCurrently, Ethereum is the most popular smart contract platform, but many other cryptocurrency blockchains (including EOS, Neo, Tezos, , , and ) can run them. A smart contract can be created and deployed to a blockchain by anyone. Their code is transparent and publicly verifiable, which means that any interested party can see exactly what logic a smart contract follows when it receives digital assets.\n  * Smart contracts are written in a variety of programming languages (including Solidity, Web Assembly, and Michelson). On the Ethereum network, each smart contract’s code is stored on the blockchain, allowing any interested party to inspect the contract’s code and current state to verify its functionality. \n  * When a smart contract receives funds from a user, its code is executed by all nodes in the network in order to reach a consensus about the outcome and resulting flow of value. This is what allows smart contracts to securely run without any central authority, even when users are making complex financial transactions with unknown entities.\n  * Once deployed onto a blockchain, smart contracts generally can’t be altered, even by their creator. (There are exceptions to this rule.)

By doing so, stakers are rewarded with additional cryptocurrency, making it a popular method for investors to earn passive income. Staking is an important part of \n, which is a resource-intensive process. Instead of having miners use computational power to solve complex math problems, PoS networks rely on validators selected based on the number of coins they hold and are willing to stake.\nIn short, staking involves locking up your cryptocurrency to participate in the activities of a blockchain network. The process may differ depending on the blockchain, but here's how it typically works:\n: In PoS blockchains, validators are chosen based on a combination of factors, including the number of coins staked, the length of time they’ve been staked, and sometimes random selection.\nDepending on your level of technical expertise and the amount of crypto you want to stake, there are different ways to do it. Some of the most common types of staking include:\n  *   * : Some cryptocurrency exchanges offer staking services, providing the easiest way to stake without handling the technicalities yourself. This method is also known as “staking as a service”. For example, you can earn daily rewards with \n  * \n\nA staking pool is a group of cryptocurrency holders who combine their staking power to increase their chances of being selected as validators. By pooling resources, participants can earn staking rewards proportionally to their contribution to the pool.\nThis option is especially beneficial for smaller investors who may not have enough coins to meet the minimum staking requirements. However, it’s essential to research and choose a reputable staking pool, as fees and security can vary.\nis a newer form of staking that allows users to stake their assets without losing liquidity. Unlike conventional staking, where assets are often locked and inaccessible during the staking period, liquid staking introduces mechanisms that enable users to maintain liquidity while still earning staking rewards.\n(LSTs), which are tokens that represent the staked assets. For instance, when you stake ETH on Binance, you will receive WBETH in return, which can be traded or used elsewhere without compromising the ETH staking rewards. Similarly, when you stake ETH on a platform like \nStaking is a way to make your idle assets work for you, meaning you can generate rewards while helping secure your favorite blockchain networks. Crypto staking is particularly common among long-term crypto holders who want to get the most out of their holdings.\n\n\nYes. It’s usually worth staking your idle crypto assets to generate passive income – especially if you are a long-term holder and want to support the project. However, the potential rewards and risks can vary depending on the cryptocurrency and platform of choice. \nFor example, if a DeFi staking platform offers great returns but fails to provide security, your staked assets could be stolen or lost. Market volatility is another risk factor that may offset rewards or cause losses.\nIf you become a PoS validator, you need to ensure your staking operations are working as intended. Validators who act maliciously or fail to maintain their node can be penalized, resulting in a loss of staked funds.\n: Some types of staking require locking up your coins for a specific period. Technical issues, like smart contract mistakes or software bugs, can result in loss of access or frozen funds.\nIf you stake through a third-party service, you are trusting others with your funds. If the platform gets hacked, your funds may be at risk. DeFi platforms may also involve similar risks, especially when you are required to grant full access to your crypto wallet.\nIn some blockchains, rewards are distributed as a fixed percentage, making it easier to predict your earnings. Staking rewards are often measured by their estimated annual returns, i.e., annual percentage rate (\nUsually, yes. You should be able to withdraw your staked crypto at any time. However, the exact mechanisms and rules will vary from one staking platform to another. In some cases, withdrawing staked assets early may lead to partial or total loss of the staking rewards.

The upgrade enables ETH stakers to opt in to automatically receive their staking rewards and withdraw their locked ETH at any time.\nStaking is specific to PoS blockchains. Cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, which operate on a PoW consensus mechanism, cannot be staked. Even within PoS networks, not all cryptocurrencies support staking, as they may use different mechanisms to incentivize participation.\nStaking cryptocurrency offers a way to participate in blockchain networks while earning rewards. Still, it’s crucial to understand the risks involved, including market volatility, third-party, slashing, and technical risks.

Investopedia does not include all offers available in the marketplace.\nIn October 2008, Nakamoto announced to the cryptography mailing list at metzdowd.com: \"I've been working on a new electronic cash system that's fully peer-to-peer, with no trusted third party.\" The now-famous white paper published on Bitcoin.org, entitled \"Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System,\" would become the Magna Carta for how Bitcoin operates today. \nOn Jan. 3, 2009, the first Bitcoin block was . Called Block 0, it is also known as the and contains the text: \"The Times 03/Jan/2009 Chancellor on brink of second bailout for banks,\" perhaps proof that the block was mined on or after that date. \nEvery four years, the Bitcoin network the reward miners earn for adding a block. This built-in feature slows the creation of new bitcoins and keeps supply limited—much like digital gold. In 2009, miners earned 50 bitcoins per block. By April 2024, that reward dropped to 3.125, and it will fall again to 1.5625 around mid-2028. This predictable scarcity is one reason many investors see Bitcoin as a hedge against . \nBitcoin, as a form of digital currency, isn't hard to understand. For example, if you own a bitcoin, you can use your cryptocurrency wallet to send smaller portions of that bitcoin as payment for goods or services. By contrast, the way Bitcoin is very complex. \nA blockchain is a distributed ledger, a shared database of information that is chained together via cryptographic techniques. \"Distributed\" means that it is stored on many computers rather than a centralized server location, as is typical of most data storage. \nA block on a is a file that contains a block header, transaction counter, and the transactions recorded in the block. The transaction counter lists the transactions in the block, while the block header is made up of several elements: \n\n\nAs noted, each block contains the hashed information of the previous block. This creates a chain of encrypted blocks (files) that contain information from all previous blocks, going back to the first block of the blockchain. \nBitcoin uses the SHA-256 hashing algorithm to encrypt (hash) the data stored in the blocks on the blockchain. Simply put, transaction data stored in a block is encrypted into a 256-bit (64-digit) hexadecimal number. That number contains all the transaction data and information linked to the blocks before that block. \nWhile the data in a block is encrypted and used in the next block, the block is not inaccessible or non-readable. The hash is used in the next block, then its hash is used in the next, and so on, but all blocks can be read. This ensures that blocks cannot be changed without changing all other blocks and ensures anyone can audit the blockchain.\nIf you don't want to mine Bitcoin, you can buy it using a . Most people will be unable to purchase an entire BTC because of its price, but you can buy portions of one BTC on most exchanges in fiat currency, such as U.S. dollars. For example, you can buy a bitcoin on by creating and funding an account using your bank account, credit card, or debit card. The following video explains more about buying Bitcoin. \nA variety of hardware and software can be used to mine Bitcoin. When the Bitcoin blockchain was first released, it was possible to mine it competitively on a personal computer. However, as it became more popular, more miners joined the network, which lowered the chances of being the one to solve the hash. \nThis is because you're competing with a network of miners that generate around 920 quintillion hashes (as of September 2025) per second. Machines—called Application Specific Integrated Circuits (ASICs) built specifically for mining, can generate more than 400 trillion hashes per second. In contrast, a computer with the latest hardware hashes around 100 megahashes per second (100 million). \nThe first option is to use your existing computer and mining software compatible with Bitcoin software and join a mining pool. Mining pools are groups of miners that combine their computational power to compete with large ASIC mining farms. There are and pools you can join. Two of the most well-known programs are CGMiner and BFGMiner. \nThe second option, if you have the financial means, is to purchase an ASIC miner. You can generally find a new one for around $10,000, but used ones are also sold by miners as they upgrade their systems. There are some significant costs, such as electricity and cooling, to consider if you purchase one or more ASICs. Keep in mind that using one or two ASICs is still no guarantee of rewards, as you're competing with businesses with large mining farms of tens, if not hundreds, of thousands of ASICs. For example, Bitcoin mining firm CleanSpark claims to have 242,222 miners deployed. \nJoining a pool can increase your chances of being rewarded bitcoins, but rewards are significantly decreased because they are shared. When , it's important to find out how it pays out rewards, what any fees might be, and read some mining pool reviews.\nBitcoin was initially designed and released as a peer-to-peer payment method. However, its use has evolved due to its increasing value, competition from other blockchains and cryptocurrencies, and developments on blockchains that process information for the Bitcoin blockchain. \nBrick-and-mortar stores that accept cryptocurrencies will generally display a sign that says \"Bitcoin Accepted Here.\" The transactions can be handled with the requisite hardware terminal or wallet address through QR codes and touchscreen apps. An online business can easily accept bitcoin by adding this payment option to its other online payment options: credit cards, PayPal, etc. \nTo use your Bitcoin, you need to have a . Wallets are your blockchain interface and can hold the private keys to the bitcoins that you own. These keys must be entered when you're conducting a transaction. \nInvestors and speculators became interested in Bitcoin as it grew in popularity. Between 2009 and 2017, emerged that facilitated Bitcoin sales and purchases. Prices began to rise, and demand slowly grew until 2017, when its price broke $1,000. \nAfter reaching about $69,000 in November 2021, Bitcoin's price crashed in 2022. In March 2022, it was as high as $47,454, but by November, it was $15,731. It then recovered in 2023, seeing a price as high as $31,474 before dropping back below $30,000. \nIn early 2024, Bitcoin's price jumped into the mid $40,000s as expectations grew for Bitcoin Spot ETFs' approval. By mid-February 2024, after the ETFs were approved, Bitcoin's price climbed to more than $50,000. In early April 2025, Bitcoin started a bull run, leading to Bitcoin beyond the $100,000 mark by hitting an all-time high of over $124,000 in August 2025. \nFollowing an increase in optimism and price after Donald Trump was re-elected in November 2024, Bitcoin breached $100,000 for the first time on Dec. 5, 2024, after years of arguments for and against its ability to do so by investors and analysts.\nBitcoin prices tend to follow stock market trends because Bitcoin is treated the same way that investors treat other investments. However, Bitcoin price movements are greatly volatile and sometimes are prone to movements of thousands of dollars. Many Bitcoin investors tend to \"trade the news,\" as demonstrated by the fluctuations occurring whenever a significant news event occurs. \nBitcoin had a price of $7,167.52 on Dec. 31, 2019, and a year later, it had appreciated more than 300% to $28,984.98. It continued to surge in the first half of 2021, trading at a record high of $69,000 in November 2021. It then fell over the next few months to hover around $40,000 and rose with increasing speed in 2024 to more than $100,000. In April of 2025, Bitcoin was down almost 25%, but it rallied to more than $115,000 in September 2025. \nAs a result of such price movements, many people purchase Bitcoin for its investment value rather than its ability to act as a . However, the lack of guaranteed value and its digital nature mean its purchase and use carry several inherent risks. \n  * : The continuous battle between cryptocurrency-related projects and regulators makes longevity and liquidity unknown. As of September 2025, Bitcoin is not considered a security by the authorities, but that stance could change in the future.\n  * : Most individuals who own and use Bitcoin have not acquired their tokens through mining operations. Rather, they buy and sell Bitcoin and other digital currencies on popular cryptocurrency exchanges. These exchanges are entirely digital and are at risk from hackers, malware, and operational glitches.\n  * : Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies are not insured by the or the . However, some exchanges provide insurance through third parties. For instance, Gemini and Coinbase offer cryptocurrency insurance, but only for failures in their systems or cybersecurity breaches. Any cash deposits you've made at either exchange might be eligible for \"pass-through\" FDIC coverage. \n  * : As with any investment, Bitcoin values can fluctuate. Indeed, the currency's value has seen wild price swings over its short existence. Subject to high volume buying and selling on exchanges, it is highly sensitive to any news events related to it. \n\n\nAs with any new technology, it has been difficult to regulate Bitcoin. The U.S. administration seeks to impose regulations on cryptocurrency but, at the same time, walks a tightrope in trying not to throttle a growing and economically beneficial industry. \nEnforcement agencies in the U.S. continue to rely on existing securities, commodities, and tax laws, but as of July 2025, SEC Chairman Paul Atkins announced Project Crypto, an initiative to modernize the rules governing cryptocurrencies. While Project Crypto does not imply new regulatory updates, it intends to correct regulatory ambiguity to encourage trading in the U.S. \nInvesting in Bitcoin is very risky, but there is also the possibility of high returns. Prices can move by thousands of dollars per day, and long-term outlooks for the cryptocurrency vary.\nAn amount of Bitcoin worth $1 is worth $1 in U.S. dollars. The value of 1 BTC in U.S. dollars varies by the minute, but on September 23, 2025, it was more than $112,000.\nBitcoin was the first cryptocurrency introduced to the public and was intended to be used as a form of payment outside of legal tender. Since its introduction in 2009, Bitcoin's popularity has surged, and its blockchain uses have expanded. \nThough the process of generating Bitcoin is complex, investing in it is more straightforward. Investors and speculators can buy and sell Bitcoin on . As with any investment, particularly one as volatile as Bitcoin, investors should carefully consider if Bitcoin is the right investment for them. \nDid you know that 82% of Nvidia’s gains between March 2024 and February 2025 happened outside of regular Nasdaq hours?* on 100+ US shares 24 hours a day, meaning you never need to miss out when the markets move. for super-fast execution backed by dedicated support. 74-89% of retail CFD accounts lose money *Data from the Pepperstone platform. \nInvestopedia requires writers to use primary sources to support their work.
